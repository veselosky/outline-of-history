27.1 The Science of Thwarting the Common Man
========================================================================
We have already twice likened the self-governing community
of Rome to a «Neanderthal» variety of the modern «democratic» civilized state,
and we shall recur again to this comparison. In form the two things, the first
great primitive essay and its later relations, are extraordinarily similar; in
spirit they differ very profoundly. Roman political and social life, and
particularly Roman political and social life in the century between the fall of
Carthage and the rise of Caesar and Caesarism, has a very marked general
resemblance to the political and social life in such countries as the United
States of America or the British Empire today. The resemblance is intensified
by the common use, with a certain inaccuracy in every case, of such terms as
«senate», «democracy», «proletariat», and the like. But everything in the Roman
state was earlier, cruder, and clumsier; the injustices were more glaring, the
conflicts harsher. There was comparatively little knowledge and few general
ideas. Aristotle's scientific works were only beginning to be read in Rome in
the first century B.C.; Ferrero,\ [#fn1]_  it is true, makes Cesar familiar with the
Politics of Aristotle, and ascribes to him the dream of making a «Periclean
Rome», but in doing so, Ferrero seems to be indulging in one of those lapses
into picturesque romancing which are at once the joy and the snare of all
historical writers.

Attention has already been drawn to the profound difference
between Roman and modern conditions due to the absence of a press, of any
popular education or of the representative idea in the popular assembly. Our
world today is still far from solving the problem of representation and from
producing a public assembly which will really summarize, crystallize, and
express the thought and will of the community; our elections are still largely
an ingenious mockery of the common voter who finds himself helpless in the face
of party organizations which reduce his free choice of a representative to the
less unpalatable of two political hacks, but, even so, his vote, in comparison
with the vote of an ordinary honest Roman citizen, is an effective instrument.
Too many of our histories dealing with this period of Roman history write of
«the popular party», and of the votes of the people and so forth, as though
such things were as much working realities as they are today. But the senators
and politicians of Rome saw to it that such things never did exist as clean and
wholesome realities. These modern phrases are very misleading unless they are
carefully qualified.

We have already described the gatherings of the popular
comitia; but that clumsy assembly in sheep pens does not convey the full extent
to which the gerrymandering of popular representation could be carried in Rome.
Whenever there was a new enfranchisement of citizens in Italy, there would be
the most elaborate trickery and counter-trickery to enrol the new voters into
as few or as many of the thirty old «tribes» as possible, or to put them into
as few as possible new tribes. Since the vote was taken by tribes, it is
obvious that however great the number of new additions made, if they were all
got together into one tribe, their opinion would only count for one tribal
vote, and similarly if they were crowded into just a few tribes, old or new. On
the other hand, if they were put into too many tribes their effect in any
particular tribe might be inconsiderable. Here was the sort of work to
fascinate every smart knave in politics. The 
*comitia tributa* could be *worked*
at times so as to vote right counter to the general feeling of the people. And
as we have already noted, the great mass of voters in Italy were also
disenfranchised by distance. About the middle period of the Carthaginian wars
there were upwards of 300,000 Roman citizens; about 100 B.C. there were more
than 900,000, but in effect the voting of the popular assembly was confined to
a few score thousand resident in and near Rome, and mostly men of a base type.
And the Roman voters were «organized» to an extent that makes the Tammany
machine of New York seem artless and honest. They belonged to clubs, 
*collegia sodalicia*, having usually some
elegant religious pretensions; and the rising politician working his way to
office went first to the usurers and then with the borrowed money to these
clubs. If the outside voters were moved enough by any question to swarm into
the city, it was always possible to put off the voting by declaring the omens
unfavourable. If they came in unarmed, they could be intimidated; if they
brought in arms, then the cry was raised that there was a plot to overthrow the
republic, and a massacre would be organized.

There can be no, doubt that all Italy, all the empire was
festering with discomfort, anxiety, and discontent in the century after the
destruction of Carthage; a few men were growing very rich, and the majority of
people found themselves entangled in an inexplicable net of uncertain prices,
jumpy markets, and debts; but yet there was no way at all of stating and
clearing up the general dissatisfaction. There is no record of a single attempt
to make the popular assembly a straightforward and workable public organ.
Beneath the superficial appearances of public affairs struggled a mute giant of
public opinion and public will, who sometimes made some great political effort
a rush to vote or such like, and sometimes broke into actual violence. So long
as there was no actual violence, the Senate and the financiers kept on in their
own disastrous way. Only when they were badly frightened would governing
cliques or parties desist from some nefarious policy and heed the common good.
The real method of popular expression in Italy in those days was not the 
*comitia tributa*, but the strike and
insurrection, the righteous and necessary methods of all cheated or suppressed
peoples. We have seen in our own days in Great Britain a decline in the
prestige of parliamentary government and a drift towards unconstitutional
methods on the part of the masses through exactly the same cause, through the
incurable disposition of politicians to gerrymander the electoral machine until
the community is driven to explosion.

For insurrectionary purposes a discontented population
needs a leader, and the political history of the concluding century of Roman
republicanism is a history of insurrectionary leaders and counter-revolutionary
leaders. Most of the former are manifestly unscrupulous adventurers who try to
utilize the public necessity and unhappiness for their own advancement. Many of
the historians of this period betray a disposition to take sides, and are
either aristocratic in tone or fiercely democratic; but, indeed, neither side
in these complex and intricate disputes has a record of high aims or clean
hands. The Senate and the rich Equestrians were vulgar and greedy spirits,
hostile and contemptuous towards the poor mob; and the populace was ignorant,
unstable, and at least equally greedy. The Scipios in all this record shine by
comparison, a group of gentlemen. To the motives of one or the other figures of
the time, to Tiberius Gracchus, for example, we may perhaps extend the benefit
of the doubt. But for the rest, they do but demonstrate how clever and cunning
men may be, how subtle in contention, how brilliant in pretence, and how utterly
wanting in wisdom or grace of spirit. «A shambling, hairy, brutish, but
probably very cunning creature with a big brain 
*behind;»* so someone, I think it was Sir Harry Johnston, has
described *Homo Neanderthalensis.*

To this day we must still use similar terms to describe the
soul of the politician. The statesman has still to oust the politician from his
lairs and weapon heaps. History has still to become a record of human dignity.
