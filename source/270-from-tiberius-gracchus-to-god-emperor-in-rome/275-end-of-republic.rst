    Figure 442: Julius Caesar

    (from the Naples bust)

But among the politicians of Italy in the first century
B.C. there were no maps of Germany and Russia, Africa and Central Asia, and no
sufficient intelligence to study them had they existed. Rome never developed
the fine curiosities that sent Hanno and the sailors of Pharaoh Necho down the
coasts of Africa. When, in the first century B.C., the emissaries of the Han
dynasty reached the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, they found only stories
of a civilization that had receded. The memory of Alexander still lived in
these lands, but of Rome men only knew that Pompey had come to the western
shores of the Caspian and gone away again, and that Crassus had been destroyed.
Rome was pre-occupied at home. What mental energy remained over in the Roman
citizen from the attempt to grow personally rich, and keep personally safe was
intent upon the stratagems and strokes and counter-strokes of the various
adventurers who were now manifestly grappling for the supreme power.

It is the custom of historians to treat these struggles
with extreme respect. In particular the figure of Julius Caesar is set up as if
it were a star of supreme brightness and importance in the history of mankind.
Yet a dispassionate consideration of the known facts fails altogether to
justify this demigod theory of Caesar. Not even that precipitate wrecker of
splendid possibilities, Alexander the Great, has been so magnified and dressed
up for the admiration of careless and uncritical readers. There is a type of
scholar who, to be plain, sits and *invents*
marvellous world policies for the more conspicuous figures in history with the
merest scraps of justification or with no justification at all. We are told
that Alexander planned the conquest of Carthage and Rome and the complete
subjugation of India and that only his death shattered these schemes. What we
know for certain is that he conquered the Persian Empire, and never went far
beyond its boundaries; and that when he was supposed to be making these vast
and noble plans, he was in fact indulging in such monstrous antics as his
mourning for his favourite Hephaestion, and as his main occupation he was
drinking himself to death. So, too, Julius Caesar is credited with the
intention of doing just that one not impossible thing which would have secured
the Roman Empire from its ultimate collapse–namely, the systematic conquest and
civilization of Europe as far as the Baltic and the Dnieper. He was to have
marched upon Germany, says Plutarch, through Parthia and Scythia, round the
north of the Caspian and Black Seas. Yet the fact we have to reconcile with
this wise and magnificent project is that at the crest of his power, Caesar,
already a bald, middle-aged man, past the graces and hot impulses of youthful
love, spent the better part of a year in Egypt, feasting and entertaining
himself in amorous pleasantries with the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra. And
afterwards he brought her with him to Rome, where her influence over him was
bitterly resented. Such complications with a woman mark the elderly sensualist
or sentimentalist– he was fifty-four at the commencement of the 
*affaire–* rather than the master-ruler of
men.

On the side of the superman idea of Caesar, we have to
count a bust in the Naples Museum. It represents a fine and intellectual face,
very noble in its expression, and we can couple with that the story that his
head, even at, birth, was unusually large and finely formed. But there is
really no satisfying evidence that this well-known bust does represent Caesar,
and it is hard to reconcile its austere serenity with the reputation for
violent impulse and disorderliness that clung to him. Other busts of a quite
different man are also, with more probability, ascribed to him.

There can be little doubt that he was a dissolute, and
extravagant young man–the scandals cluster thick about his sojourn in Bithynia,
whither he fled from Sulla; he was the associate of the reprobate Clodius and
the conspirator Catiline, and there is nothing in his political career to
suggest any aim higher or remoter than his own advancement to power, and all
the personal glory and indulgence that power makes possible. We will not
attempt to tell here of the turns and devices of his career. Although he was of
an old patrician family, he came into politics as the brilliant darling of the people.
He spent great sums and incurred heavy debts to provide public festivals on the
most lavish scale. He opposed the tradition of Sulla, and cherished the memory
of Marius, who was his uncle by marriage. For a time he worked in conjunction
with Crassus and Pompey, but after the death of Crassus he and Pompey came into
conflict. By 49 B.C. he and Pompey, with their legions, he from the west and
Pompey from the east, were fighting openly for predominance in the Roman state.
He had broken the law by bringing his legions across the Rubicon, which was the
boundary between his command and Italy proper. At the battle of Pharsalos in
Thessaly (48 B.C.), Pompey was routed, and, fleeing to Egypt, was murdered,
leaving Caesar more master of the Roman world than ever Sulla had been.

He was then created dictator for ten years in 46 B.C., and
early in 45 B.C. he was made dictator for life. This was monarchy; if not
hereditary monarchy, it was at least electoral life monarchy. It was unlimited
opportunity to do his best for the world. And by the spirit and quality of his
use of this dictatorial power during these four years we are bound to judge
him. A certain reorganization of local administration he effected, and he seems
to have taken up what was a fairly obvious necessity of the times, a project
for the restoration of the two murdered seaports of Corinth and Carthage, whose
destruction had wrecked the sea-life of the Mediterranean. But much more
evident was the influence of Cleopatra and Egypt upon his mind. Like Alexander
before him, his head seems to have been turned by the king-god tradition,
assisted no doubt in his case by the adulation of that charming hereditary
goddess, Cleopatra, We find evidence of exactly that same conflict upon the
score of divine pretensions, between him and his personal friends, that we have
already recorded in the case of Alexander. So far as the Hellenized east was
concerned, the paying of divine honours to rulers was a familiar idea; but it
was still repulsive to the lingering Aryanism of Rome.

Antony, who had been his second in command at Pharsalos,
was one of the chief of his flatterers. Plutarch describes a scene at the
public games in which Antony tried to force a crown upon Caesar, which Caesar,
after a little coyness and in face of the manifested displeasure of the crowd,
refused. But he had adopted the ivory sceptre and throne, which were the
traditional insignia of the ancient kings of Rome. His image was carried amidst
that of the gods in the opening *pompa*
of the arena, and his statue was set up in a temple with an inscription, «To
the Unconquerable God!» Priests even were appointed for his godhead. These
things are not the symptoms of great-mindedness, but of a common man's
megalomania. Caesar's record of vulgar scheming for the tawdriest mockeries of
personal worship is a silly and shameful record; it is incompatible with the
idea that he was a wise and wonderful superman setting the world to rights.

Finally (44 B.C.) he was assassinated by a group of his own
friends and supporters, to whom these divine aspirations had become
intolerable. He was beset in the Senate, and stabbed in three and twenty
places, dying at the foot of the statue of his fallen rival Pompey the Great.
The scene marks the complete demoralization of the old Roman governing body.
Brutus, the ringleader of the murderers, would have addressed the senators,
but, confronted by this crisis, they were scuttling off in every direction. For
the best part of a day Rome did not know what to make of this event; the murderers
marched about with their bloody weapons through an undecided city, with no one
gainsaying them and only a few joining them; then public opinion turned against
them, some of their houses were attacked, and they had to hide and fly for
their lives.
