27.6 The Coming of the Princeps
========================================================================
But the trend of things was overwhelmingly towards
monarchy. For thirteen years more the struggle of personalities went on. One
single man is to be noted as inspired by broad ideas and an ambition not
entirely egoistic, Cicero. He was a man of modest origin, whose eloquence and
literary power had won him a prominent place in the Senate. He was a little
tainted by the abusive tradition of Demosthenes, nevertheless he stands out, a
noble and pathetically ineffective figure, pleading with the now utterly
degenerate, base, and cowardly Senate for the high ideals of the Republic. He
was a writer of great care and distinction, and the orations and private
letters he has left us make him one of the most real and living figures of this
period to the modern reader. He was proscribed and killed in 43 B.C., the year
after the murder of Julius Caesar, and his head and hands were nailed up in the
Roman forum. Octavian, who became at last the monarch of Rome, seems to have
made an effort to save Cicero; that murder was certainly not his crime.

Here we cannot trace out the tangle of alliances and
betrayals that ended in the ascendancy of this Octavian, the adopted heir of
Julius Caesar. The fate of the chief figures is interwoven with that of Cleopatra.

After the death of Caesar, she set herself to capture the
emotions and vanity of Antony, a much younger man than Caesar, with whom she
was probably already acquainted. For a time Octavian and Antony and a third
figure, Lepidus, divided the Roman world just as Caesar and Pompey had divided
it before their final conflict. Octavian took the hardier west, and
consolidated his power; Antony had the more gorgeous east–and Cleopatra. To
Lepidus fell that picked bone, Carthaginian Africa. He seems to have been a
good man of good traditions, set upon the restoration of Carthage rather than
upon wealth or personal vanities. The mind of Antony succumbed to those same
ancient ideas of divine kingship that had already proved too much for the
mental equilibrium of Julius Caesar. In the company of Cleopatra he gave
himself up to love, amusements, and a dream of sensuous glory, until Octavian
felt that the time was ripe to end these two Egyptian divinities.

In 32 B.C. Octavian induced the Senate to depose Antony
from the command of the east, and proceeded to attack him. A great naval battle
at Actium (31 B.C.) was decided by the unexpected desertion of Cleopatra with
sixty ships in the midst of the fight. It is quite impossible for us to decide
now whether this was due to premeditated treachery or to the sudden whim of a
charming woman. The departure of these ships threw the fleet of Antony into
hopeless confusion, which was increased by the headlong flight of this model
lover in pursuit. He went off in a swift galley after her without informing his
commanders. He left his followers to fight and die as they thought fit, and for
a time they were incredulous that he had gone. The subsequent encounter of the
two lovers and their reconciliation is a matter for ironical speculation on the
part of Plutarch.

Octavian's net closed slowly round his rival. It is not
improbable that there was some sort of understanding between Octavian and
Cleopatra, as perhaps in the time of Julius Caesar there may have been between
the queen and Antony. Antony gave way to much mournful posturing, varied by
love scenes, during this last stage of his little drama. For a time he posed as
an imitator of the cynic Timon, as one who had lost all faith in mankind,
though one may think that his deserted sailors at Actium had better reason for
such an attitude. Finally he found himself and Cleopatra besieged by Octavian
in Alexandria. There were some sallies and minor successes, and Antony was loud
with challenges to Octavian to decide the matter by personal combat. Being led
to believe that Cleopatra had committed suicide, this star of romance stabbed
himself, but so ineffectually as to die lingeringly, and he was carried off to
expire in her presence (30 B.C.).

Plutarch's account of Antony, which was derived very
largely from witnesses who had seen and known him, describes him as of heroic
mould. He is compared to the demigod Hercules, from whom indeed he claimed
descent, and also, to the Indian Bacchus. There is a disgusting but
illuminating description of a scene in the Senate when he attempted to speak
while drunk, and was overtaken by one of the least dignified concomitants of
intoxication.

For a little while Cleopatra still clung to life, and
perhaps to the hope that she might reduce Octavian to the same divine role that
had already been played by Julius Caesar and Antony. She had an interview with
Octavian, in which she presented herself as beauty in distress and very lightly
clad. But when it became manifest that Octavian lacked the godlike spark, and that
his care for her comfort and welfare was dictated chiefly by his desire to
exhibit her in a triumphal procession through the streets of Rome, she also
committed suicide. An asp was smuggled to her past the Roman sentries,
concealed in a basket of figs, and by its fangs she died.

Octavian seems to have been almost entirely free from the
divine aspirations of Julius Caesar and Antony. He was neither God nor romantic
hero; he was a man. He was a man of far greater breadth and capacity than any
other player in this last act of the Republican drama in Rome. All things
considered, he was perhaps the best thing that could have happened to Rome at
that time. He «voluntarily resigned the extraordinary powers which he had held
since 43, and, to quote his own words, 'handed over the republic to the control
of the senate and the people of Rome.' The old constitutional machinery was
once more set in motion; the senate, assembly, and magistrates resumed their
functions, and Octavian himself was hailed as the 'restorer of the commonwealth
and the champion of freedom.' It was not so easy to determine what relation he
himself, the actual master of the Roman world, should occupy towards this
revived republic. His abdication, in any real sense of the word, would have
simply thrown everything back into confusion. The interests of peace and order
required that he should retain at least the substantial part of his authority;
and this object was in fact accomplished, and the rule of the emperors founded
in a manner which has no parallel in history. Any revival of the kingly title
was out of the question, and Octavian himself expressly refused the
dictatorship. Nor was any new office created or any new official title invented
for his benefit. But by senate and people he was invested according to the old
constitutional forms with certain powers, as many citizens had been before him,
and so took his place by the side of the lawfully appointed magistrates of the
republic; only, to mark his pre-eminent dignity, as the first, of them all, the
senate decreed that he should take as an additional cognomen that of
'Augustus,' while in common parlance he was henceforth styled Princeps, a
simple title of courtesy, familiar to republican usage and conveying no other
idea than that of a recognized primacy and precedence over his fellow-citizens.
The ideal sketched by Cicero in his *De
Republica,* of a constitutional president of a free republic, was apparently
realized; but it was only in appearance. For in fact the special prerogatives
conferred upon Octavian gave him back in substance the autocratic authority he
had resigned, and as between the restored republic and its new 
*princeps* the balance of power was
overwhelmingly on the side of the latter».\ [#fn7]_
