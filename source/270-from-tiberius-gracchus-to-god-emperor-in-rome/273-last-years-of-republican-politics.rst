27.3 The Last Years of Republican Politics
========================================================================

The first conspicuous leader to appeal to the gathering
revolutionary feeling in Italy was Tiberius Gracchus. He looks more like an
honest man than any other figure in this period of history, unless it be Scipio
Africanus the Elder. At first Tiberius Gracchus was a moderate reformer of a
rather reactionary type. He wished to restore the yeoman class to property very
largely because he believed that class to be the backbone of the army, and his
military experience in Spain before and after the destruction of Carthage had
impressed upon him the declining efficiency of the legions. He was what we
should call nowadays a «Back-to-the-land» man. He did not understand and few
people understand today, how much easier it is to shift population from the
land into the towns, than to return it to the laborious and simple routines of
agricultural life. He wanted to revive the Licinian laws, which had been
established when Camillus built his temple of Concord nearly two centuries and
a half before (see Chap. xxvi, sec 2), so far as they broke up great estates
and restrained slave labour.

These Licinian laws had repeatedly been revived and
repeatedly lapsed to a dead letter again. It was only when the big proprietors
in the Senate opposed this proposal that Tiberius Gracchus turned to the people
and began a furious agitation for popular government. He created a commission
to inquire into the title of all landowners. In the midst of his activities
occurred one of the most extraordinary incidents in history. Attalus, the king
of the rich country of Pergamum in Asia Minor, died (133 B.C.), and left his
kingdom to the Roman people.

It is difficult for us to understand the motives of this
bequest. Pergamum was a country allied to Rome, and so moderately secure from
aggression; and the natural consequence of such a will was to provoke a violent
scramble among the senatorial gangs and a dispute between them and the people
for the spoils of the new acquisition. Practically Attalus handed over his
country to be looted. There were of course many Italian business people
established in the country and a strong party of native rich men in close
relations with Rome. To them, no doubt, a coalescence with the Roman system
would have been acceptable. Josephus bears witness to such a desire for
annexation among the rich men of Syria, a desire running counter to the wishes
of both king and people. This Pergamum bequest, astonishing in itself, had the
still more astonishing result of producing imitations in other quarters. In 96
B.C. Ptolemy Apion bequeathed Cyrenaica, in North Africa, to the Roman people;
in 81 B.C. Alexander II, King of Egypt, followed suit with Egypt, a legacy too
big for the courage if not for the appetite of the Senators, and they declined
it; in 74 B.C. Nicomedes, King of Bithynia, demised Bithynia. Of these latter
testamentary freaks we will say no more here. But it will be manifest how great
an opportunity, was given Tiberius Gracchus by the bequest of Attalus, of
accusing the rich of greed and of proposing to decree the treasures of Attalus
to the commonalty. He proposed to use this new wealth to provide seed, stock,
and agricultural implements for the resettlement of the land.

His movement was speedily entangled in the complexities of
the Roman electoral system–without a simple and straight-forward electoral
method, all popular movements in all ages necessarily become entangled and
maddened in constitutional intricacies, and almost as necessarily lead to
bloodshed, It was needed, if his work was to go on, that Tiberius Gracchus
should continue to be tribune, and it was illegal for him to be tribune twice
in succession. He overstepped the bounds of legality, and stood for the
tribuneship a second time; the peasants who came in from the countryside to
vote for him came in armed; the cry that he was aiming at a tyranny, the cry that
had long ago destroyed Maelius and Manlius, was raised in the Senate, the
friends of «law and order» went to the Capitol in state, accompanied by a
rabble of dependents armed with staves and bludgeons; there was a conflict, or
rather a massacre of the revolutionaries, in which nearly three hundred people
were killed, and Tiberius Gracchus was beaten to death with the fragments of a
broken bench by two Senators.

Thereupon the Senators attempted a sort of
counter-revolution, and proscribed many of the followers of Tiberius Gracchus;
but the state of public opinion was so sullen and threatening that this
movement was dropped and Scipio Nasica, who was implicated in the death of
Tiberius, though he occupied the position of pontifex maximus and should have
remained in Rome for the public sacrifices which were the duties of that
official, went abroad to avoid trouble.

The uneasiness of Italy next roused Scipio Africanus the
Younger to propose the enfranchisement of all Italy. But he died suddenly
before he could carry the proposal into effect.

Then followed the ambiguous career of Caius Gracchus, the
brother of Tiberius, who followed some tortuous «policy» that still exercises
the mind of historians. He increased the burdens of taxation laid upon the
provinces, it is supposed with the idea of setting the modern financiers (the
Equites) against the senatorial landowners. He gave the former the newly
bequeathed taxes of Asia to farm, and, what is worse, he gave them control of
the special courts set up to prevent extortion. He started enormous public
works and particularly the construction of new roads, and he is accused of
making a political use of the contracts. He revived the proposal to enfranchise
Italy. He increased the distribution of subsidized cheap corn to the Roman
citizens. . . . Here we cannot attempt to disentangle his schemes, much less to
judge him. But that his policy was offensive to the groups that, controlled the
Senate there can be no doubt whatever. He was massacred by the champions of
«law and order», with about three thousands of his followers, in the streets of
Rome in 121 B.C. His decapitated head was carried to the Senate on the point of
a pike.

(A reward of its weight in gold, says Plutarch, had been
offered for this trophy: and its captor, acting in the true spirit of a
champion of «big business», filled the brain-case with lead on its way to the
scales.)

In spite of these prompt firm measures the Senate was not
to enjoy the benefits of peace and the advantages of a control of the imperial
resources for long. Within ten years the people were in revolt again.

In 118 B.C. the throne of Numidia, the semi-barbaric
kingdom that had arisen in North Africa upon the ruins of the civilized
Carthaginian power, was seized by a certain able Jugurtha, who had served with
the Roman armies in Spain, and had a knowledge of the Roman character. He
provoked the military intervention of Rome. But the Romans found that their
military power, under a Senate of financiers and landlords, was very different
from what it had been even in the days of the younger Scipio Africanus.
«Jugurtha bought over the Commissioners sent out to watch him, the Senators
charged with their prosecution, and the generals in command against him».\ [#fn2]_ 
There is a mistaken Roman proverb: *«pecunia
non olet*» (money does not stink), for the money of Jugurtha stank even in
Rome. There was an angry agitation; and a capable soldier of lowly origin,
Marius, was carried to the consulship (107 B.C.) on the wave of popular
indignation. Marius made no attempt on the model of the Gracchi to restore the
backbone of the army by rehabilitating the yeoman class. He was a professional
soldier with a high standard of efficiency and a disposition to take short
cuts.

He simply raised troops from among the poor, whether
countrymen or townsmen, paid them well, disciplined them thoroughly, and (106
B.C.) ended the seven years' war with Jugurtha by bringing that chieftain in
chains to Rome. It did not occur to anybody that incidentally Marius had also
created a professional army with no interest to hold it together but its pay.
He then held on to the consulship more or less illegally for several years, and
in 102 and 101 B.C. repelled a threatening move of the Germans (who thus appear
in our history for the first time), who were raiding through Gaul towards
Italy. He gained two victories, one on Italian soil. He was hailed as the
saviour of his country, a second Camillus (100 B.C.).

The social tensions of the time mocked that comparison with
Camillus. The Senate benefited by the greater energy in foreign affairs and the
increased military efficiency that Marius had introduced, but the sullen,
shapeless discontent of the mass of the people was still seeking some effective
outlet. The rich grew richer and the poor poorer. It was impossible to stifle
the consequences of that process forever by political trickery. The Italian
people were still unenfranchised. Two extreme democratic leaders, Saturninus,
and Glaucia, were assassinated, but that familiar senatorial remedy failed to assuage
the populace on this occasion. In 92 B.C. an aristocratic official, Rutilius
Rufus, who had tried to restrain the exactions of the financiers in Asia Minor,
was condemned on a charge of corruption so manifestly trumped up that it
deceived no one; and in 91 B.C., Livius Drusus, a newly elected tribune of the
people, who was making capital out of the trial of Rutilius Rufus, was
assassinated. He had proposed a general enfranchisement of the Italians, and he
had foreshadowed not only another land law, but a general abolition of debts.
Yet for all this vigour on the part of the senatorial usurers, land grabbers,
and forestallers, the hungry and the anxious were still insurgent. The murder
of Drusus was the last drop in the popular cup; Italy blazed into a desperate
insurrection.

There followed two years of bitter civil war, the Social
War. It was a war between the idea of a united Italy and the idea of the role
of the Roman Senate. It was not a «social» war in the modern sense, but a war
between Rome and her Italian allies (allies= Socii). «Roman generals, trained
in the traditions of colonial warfare, marched ruthlessly up and down Italy,
burning farms, sacking towns, and carrying off men, women, and children, to
sell them in the open market or work them in gangs upon their estates».\ [#fn3]_ 
Marius and an aristocratic general, Sulla, who had been with him in Africa and
who was his bitter rival, both commanded on the side of Rome. But though the
insurgents experienced defeats and looting, neither of these generals brought
the war to an end. It was ended in a manner (89 B.C.) by the practical
surrender of the Roman Senate to the idea of reform. The spirit was taken out
of the insurrection by the concession of their demands «in principle»; and then
as soon as the rebels had dispersed, the usual cheating of the new voters, by
such methods as we have explained in :doc:`Section 1 <271-science-of-thwarting-common-man>` of this chapter, was resumed.

By the next year (88 B.C.) the old round had begun again.
It was mixed up with the personal intrigues of Marius and Sulla against each
other; but the struggle had taken on another complexion through the army
reforms of Marius, which had created a new type of legionary, a landless
professional soldier with no interest in life but pay and plunder, and with no
feeling of loyalty except to a successful general. A popular tribune,
Sulpicius, was bringing forward some new laws affecting debt, and the consuls
were dodging the storm by declaring a suspension of public business. Then came
the usual resort to violence, and the followers of Sulpicius drove the consuls
from the forum. But here it is that the now forces which the new army had made
possible came into play. King Mithridates of Pontus, the Hellenized king of the
southern shores of the Black Sea cast of Bithynia, was pressing Rome into war.
One of the proposed laws of Sulpicius was that Marius should command the armies
sent against this Mithridates. Whereupon Sulla marched the army he had
commanded throughout the Social War to Rome, Marius and Sulpicius fled, and a
new age, an age of military *pronunciamentos*,
began.

Of how Sulla had himself made commander against Mithridates
and departed, and of how legions friendly to Marius then seized power, how
Marius returned to Italy and enjoyed a thorough massacre of his political opponents
and, died, sated, of fever, we cannot tell in any detail. But one measure
during the Marian reign of terror did much to relieve the social tension, and
that was the abolition of three-quarters of all outstanding debts. Nor can we
tell here how Sulla made a discreditable peace with Mithridates (who had
massacred a hundred thousand Italians in Asia Minor) in order to bring his
legions back to Rome, defeat the Marians at the battle of the Colline Gate of
Rome, and reverse the arrangements of Marius. Sulla restored law and order by
the proscription and execution of over five thousand people. He desolated large
parts of Italy, restored the Senate to power, repealed many of the recent laws,
though he was unable to restore the cancelled burden of debt, and then, feeling
bored by politics and having amassed great riches, he retired with an air of
dignity into private life, gave himself up to abominable vices, and so
presently died, eaten up with some disgusting disease produced by debauchery.
