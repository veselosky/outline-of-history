9.3 No Sub-men in America
================================================================

Nor is there any convincing evidence of man in America before the end of the
Pleistocene.\ [#fn5]_ The same relaxation of the climate that permitted the
retreat of the reindeer hunters into Russia and Siberia, as the Neolithic
tribes advanced, may have allowed them to wander across the land, that is now
cut by Bering Strait, and so reach the American continent.

They spread thence southward, age by-age. When they reached South America,
they found the giant sloth (the *Megatherium),* the glyptodon, and many other
extinct creatures, still flourishing. The glyptodon was a monstrous South
American armadillo, and a human skeleton has been found by Roth buried
beneath its huge tortoise-like shell.\ [#fn6]_

All the human remains in America, even the earliest, it is to be noted, are
of an Amer-Indian character. In America there does not seem to have been any
preceding races of sub-men. Man was fully man when he entered America. The
old world was the nursery of the sub-races of mankind.

.. [#fn5] "The various finds of human remains in North America for which the
    geological antiquity has been claimed have been thus briefly passed under
    review. In every instance here enough of the bones is preserved for
    comparison, the evidence bears witness against the geological antiquity of
    the remains and for their close affinity to or identity with the modern
    Indian." (Smithsonian Institute, Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 33.
    Dr. Hrdlicka.) But J. Deniker quotes evidence to show that eoliths and early
    paleoliths have been found in America. See his compact but full summary of
    the evidence and views for and against in his :t:`Races of Man`, pp. 510, 511.
