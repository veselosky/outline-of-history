Preface to the Mindvessel Edition
=================================
At the end of the first World War, famed writer and futurist H. G. Wells embarked on a project to explain the entirety of human history in a single narrative flow. In 1920, the work was published as two bound volumes entitled :t:`The Outline of History`. The History seems to have struck a chord with the reader of the day. With the horrors of the Great War still fresh in mind, and it's consequences deeply effecting one's daily life, perhaps an interpretive explanation of the arc that brought civilization to such a state was a comfort. Regardless of reasons, the book became quite popular and is in fact still in print (see :doc:`get-it`).

The text of this great work is now in the `public domain`_ in the United States. This web site is a reformulation of that public domain text into a form more appropriate to representation on the web.

A table of contents is printed in the sidebar of each page for convenience. Please see the :doc:`copyright` page for a detailed explanation of the copyright status of this site. Happy reading!
