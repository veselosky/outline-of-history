24.2 The Philosophy of Alexandria
========================================================================
At first the mental activities of Alexandria centered upon
the Museum, and were mainly scientific. Philosophy, which in a more vigorous
age had been a doctrine of power over self and the material world, without
abandoning these pretensions, became in reality a doctrine of secret
consolation. The stimulant changed into an opiate. The philosopher let the
world, as the vulgar say, rip the world of which he was a part, and consoled
himself by saying in very beautiful and elaborate forms that the world was
illusion and that there was in him something quintessential and sublime outside
and above the world. Athens, politically insignificant, but still a great and
crowded mart throughout the fourth century, decaying almost imperceptibly so
far as outer seeming went, and treated with a strange respect that was half
contempt by all the warring powers and adventurers of the world, was the
fitting centre of such philosophical teaching. It was quite a couple of
centuries before the schools of Alexandria became as important in philosophical
discussion.
