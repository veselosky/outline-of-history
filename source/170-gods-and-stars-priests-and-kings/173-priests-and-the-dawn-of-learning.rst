17.3 Priests and the Dawn of Learning
================================================================
This clear evidence of astronomical inquiry and of a development of
astronomical ideas is the most obvious, but only the most obvious evidence of
the very considerable intellectual activities that went on within the temple
precincts in ancient times. There is a curious disposition among many modern
writers to deprecate priesthoods and to speak of priests as though they had
always been impostors and tricksters, preying upon the simplicity of mankind.
But, indeed, they were for long the only writing class, the only reading
public, the only learned and the only thinkers; they were all the
professional classes of the time. You could have no intellectual life at all;
you could not get access to literature or any knowledge except through the
priesthood. The temples were not only observatories and libraries and
clinics, they were museums and treasure-houses. The original `Periplus of Hanno`_
hung in one temple in Carthage, skins of his "gorillas" were hung and
treasured in another. Whatever there was of abiding worth in the life of the
community sheltered there. Herodotus, the early Greek historian (485- 425
B.C.), collected most of his material from the priests of the countries in
which he travelled, and it is evident they met him generously and put their
very considerable resources completely at his disposal. Outside the temples
the world was still a world of blankly illiterate and unspeculative human
beings, living from day to day entirely for themselves. Moreover, there is
little evidence that the commonalty felt cheated by the priests, or had
anything but trust and affection for the early priesthoods. Even the great
conquerors of later times were anxious to keep themselves upon the right side
of the priests of the nations and cities whose obedience they desired,
because of the immense popular influence of these priests.

No doubt there were great differences between temple and temple and cult and
cult in the spirit and quality of the priesthood. Some probably were cruel,
some vicious and greedy, many dull and doctrinaire, stupid with tradition,
but it has to be kept in mind that there were distinct limits to the
degeneracy or inefficiency of a priesthood. It had to keep its grip upon the
general mind. It could not go beyond what people would stand â€” either towards
the darkness or towards the light. Its authority rested, in the end, on the
persuasion that its activities were propitious.
