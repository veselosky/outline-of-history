38.3 The Fermentation of Ideas, 1848
========================================================================
To trace any broad outlines in the fermentation of ideas that went on during
the mechanical and industrial revolution of the nineteenth century is a very
difficult task. But we must attempt it if we are to link what has gone before in
this history with the condition of our world to-day.

It will be convenient to distinguish two main periods in the 'hundred years
between 1814 and 1914. First came the period 1814-48, in which there was a very
considerable amount of liberal thinking and writing in *limited circles*,
but during which there were no great changes or development of thought in the
general mass of the people. Throughout this period the world's affairs were
living, so to speak, on their old intellectual capital, they were going on in
accordance with the leading ideas of the Revolution and the counter-revolution.
The dominant liberal ideas, were freedom and a certain vague equalitarianism;
the conservative, ideas were monarchy, organized religion, social privilege, and
obedience.

Until 1848 the spirit of the Holy Alliance, the spirit of Metternich,
struggled to prevent a revival of the European revolution that Napoleon had
betrayed and set back. In America, both North, and South, on the other hand, the
revolution had triumphed and nineteenth-century liberalism ruled unchallenged.
Britain was an uneasy country, never quite loyally reactionary nor quite loyally
progressive, neither truly monarchist nor truly republican, the land of Cromwell
and also of the Merry Monarch Charles; anti-Austrian, anti-Bourbon, anti-papal,
yet, weakly repressive. We have told of the first series of liberal storms in
Europe in and about the year 1830; in Britain in 1832 a Reform Bill, greatly
extending the franchise and restoring something, of its representative character
to the House of Commons, relieved the situation. Round and about 1848 came a
second and much more serious system of outbreaks, that overthrew the Orleans
monarchy and established a second Republic in France (1848-52), raised North
Italy and Hungary against Austria, and the Poles in Posen against the Germans,
and sent the Pope in flight from the republicans of Rome. A very interesting
Pan-Slavic conference held at Prague foreshadowed, many of the territorial
readjustments of 1919, it dispersed after an insurrection at Prague had been
suppressed by Austrian troops.

Ultimately all these insurrections failed; the current system staggered, but
kept its feet. There were no doubt serious social discontents beneath these
revolts, but as yet, except in the case of Paris, these had no very clear form;
and this 1848 storm, so as far as the rest of Europe was concerned, may be best
described, in a phrase, as a revolt of the natural political map against the
artificial arrangements of the Vienna diplomatists, and the system of
suppressions those arrangements entailed.

The history of Europe, then, from 1815 to 1848 was, generally speaking, a
sequel to the history of Europe from 1789 to 1814. There were no really new
*motifs* in the composition. The main trouble was still the struggle,
though often a blind and misdirected struggle, of the interests of ordinary men
against the Great Power system which cramped and oppressed the life of
mankind.

But after 1848, from 1848 to 1914, though the readjustment of the map still
went on towards a free and unified Italy and a unified Germany, there began a
fresh phase in the process of mental and political adaptation to the new
knowledge and the new material powers of mankind. Came a great irruption of new
social, religious, and political ideas into the general European mind. In the
next three sections we will consider the origin and quality of these irruptions.
They laid the foundations upon which we base our political thought to-day, but
for a long time they had no very great effect on contemporary politics.
Contemporary politics continued to run on in the old lines, but with a steadily
diminishing support in the intellectual convictions and consciences of men. We
have already described the way in which a strong intellectual process undermined
the system of Grand Monarchy in France before 1789. A similar undermining
process was going on throughout Europe during the Great Power period of
1848-1914. Profound doubts of the system of government and of the liberties of
many forms of property in the economic system spread throughout the social body.
Then came the greatest and most disorganizing war in history, so that it is
still impossible to estimate the power and range of the accumulated new ideas of
those sixty-six years. We have been through a greater catastrophe even than the
Napoleonic catastrophe, and we are in a slack-water period, corresponding to the
period 1815-30. Our 1830 and our 1848 are still to come and show us where we
stand.
