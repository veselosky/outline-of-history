    Figure 56: Map of Europe and Western Asia 50,000 years Ago

    This map represents the present state of our knowledge of the geography of
    Europe and western Asia at a period which we guess to be about 50,000 years
    ago, the Neanderthaler age. Much of this map is of course speculative, but
    its broad outlines must be fairly like those of the world in which men first
    became men.


In the time of the Third Interglacial period the outline of Europe and
Western Asia was very different from what it is today. Vast areas to the west
and north-west which are now under the Atlantic waters were then dry land;
the Irish Sea and the North Sea were river valleys. Over these northern areas
there spread and receded and spread again a great ice cap such as covers
central Greenland today (see :ref:`Figure 56`). This vast ice cap, which covered
both polar regions of the earth, withdrew huge masses of water from the
ocean, and the sea-level consequently fell, exposing great areas of land that
are now submerged again. The Mediterranean area was probably a great valley
below the general sea-level, containing two inland seas cut off from the
general ocean. The climate of this Mediterranean basin was perhaps cold
temperate, and the region of the Sahara to the south was not then a desert of
baked rock and blown sand, but a well-watered and fertile country. Between
the ice sheets to the north and the Alps and Mediterranean valley to the
south stretched a bleak wilderness whose climate changed from harshness to a
mild kindliness and then hardened again for the Fourth Glacial Age.

Across this wilderness, which is now the great plain of Europe, wandered a
various fauna. At first there were hippopotami, rhinoceroses, mammoths, and
elephants. The sabre-toothed tiger was diminishing towards extinction. Then,
as the air chilled, the hippopotamus, and then other warmth-loving creatures,
ceased to come so far north, and the sabre-toothed tiger disappeared
altogether. The woolly mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the musk ox, the
bison, the aurochs, and the reindeer became prevalent, and the temperate
vegetation gave place to plants of a more arctic type. The glaciers spread
southward to the maximum of the Fourth Glacial Age (about 50,000 years ago),
and then receded again. In the earlier phase, the Third Interglacial period,
a certain number of small family groups of men *(Homo Neanderthalensis)* and
probably of sub-men (:doc:`Eoanthropus </70-the-ancestry-of-man/74-the-piltdown-sub-man>`) wandered over the land, leaving
nothing but their flint implements to witness to their presence. They
probably used a multitude and variety of wooden implements also; they had
probably learnt much about the shapes of objects and the use of different
shapes from wood, knowledge which they afterwards applied to stone; but none
of this wooden material has survived; we can only speculate about its forms
and uses. As the weather hardened to its maximum of severity, the Neanderthal
men, already it would seem acquainted with the use of fire, began to seek
shelter under rock ledges and in caves â€“ and so leave remains behind them.
Hitherto they had been accustomed to squat in the open about the fire, and
near their water supply. But they were sufficiently intelligent to adapt
themselves to the new and harder conditions. (As for the sub-men, they seem
to have succumbed to the stresses of this Fourth Glacial Age altogether. At
any rate, the rudest type of Paleolithic implements presently disappears.)

Not merely man was taking to the caves. This period also had a cave lion, a
cave bear, and a cave hyena. These creatures had to be driven out of the
caves and kept out of the caves in which these early men wanted to squat and
hide; and no doubt fire was an effective method of eviction and protection.
Probably early men did not go deeply into the caves, because they had no
means of lighting their recesses. They got in far enough to be out of the
weather, and stored wood and food in odd corners. Perhaps they barricaded the
cave mouths. Their only available light for going deeply into the caverns
would be torches.

    Figure 58: Neanderthal Man

What did these Neanderthal men hunt? Their only possible weapons for killing
such giant creatures as the mammoth or the cave bear, or even the reindeer,
were spears of wood, wooden clubs, and those big pieces of flint they left
behind them, the "Chellean" and "Mousterian" implements;\ [#fn02]_ and probably
their usual quarry was smaller game. But they did certainly eat the flesh of
the big beasts when they had a chance, and perhaps they followed them when
sick or when wounded by combats, or took advantage of them when they were
bogged or in trouble with ice or water. (The Labrador Indians still kill the
caribou with spears at awkward river crossings.) At Dewlish, in Dorset, an
artificial trench has been found which is supposed to have been a Paleolithic
trap for elephants.\ [#fn03]_ We know that the Neanderthalers partly ate their
kill where it fell; but they brought back the big narrow bones to the cave to
crack and eat at leisure, because few ribs and vertebrae are found in the
caves, but great quantities of cracked and split long bones. They used skins
to wrap about them, and the women probably dressed the skins.

We know also that they were right-handed like modern men, because the left
side of the brain (which serves the right side of the body) is bigger than
the right. But while the back parts of the brain which deal with sight and
touch and the energy of the body are well developed, the front parts, which
are connected with thought and speech, are comparatively small. It was as big
a brain as ours, but different. This species of *Homo* had certainly a very
different mentality from ours; its individuals were not merely simpler and
lower than we are, they were on another line. It may be they did not speak at
all, or very sparingly. They had nothing that we should call a language.

.. [#fn01] Three phases of human history before the knowledge and use of metals are often distinguished. First there is the so-called Eolithic Age (dawn of stone implements), then the Paleolithic Age (old stone implements), and finally an age in which the implements are skillfully made and frequently well finished and polished (Neolithic Age). The Paleolithic Period is further divided into an earlier (sub-human) and a later (fully human) period. We shall comment on these divisions later.
