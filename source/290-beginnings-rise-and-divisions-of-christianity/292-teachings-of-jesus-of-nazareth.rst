29.2 The Teachings of Jesus of Nazareth
========================================================================
The audience to which this book will first be presented
will be largely an audience of Christians, with perhaps a sprinkling of Jewish
readers, and the former at least will regard Jesus of Nazareth as being much
more than a human teacher, and his appearance in the world not as a natural
event in history, but as something of a supernatural sort interrupting and
changing that steady development of life towards a common consciousness and a
common will, which we have hitherto been tracing in this book. But these
persuasions, dominant as they are in Europe and America, are nevertheless not
the persuasions of all men or of the great majority of mankind, and we are
writing this outline of the story of life with as complete an avoidance of
controversial matter as may be. We are trying to write as if this book was to
be read as much by Hindus or Moslems or Buddhists as by Americans and Western
Europeans. We shall therefore hold closely to the apparent facts, and avoid,
without any disputation or denial, the theological interpretations that have
been imposed upon them. We shall tell what men have believed about Jesus of
Nazareth, but him we shall treat as being what he appeared to be, a man, just
as a painter must needs paint him as a man. The documents that testify to his
acts and teachings we shall treat as ordinary human documents. If the light of
divinity shine through our recital, we will neither help nor hinder it. This is
what we have already done in the case of Buddha, and what we shall do later
with Muhammad. About Jesus we have to write not theology but history, and our
concern is not with the spiritual and theological significance of his life, but
with its effects upon the political and every-day life of men.

Almost our only sources of information about the
personality of Jesus are derived from the four gospels, all of which were
certainly in existence a few decades after his death, and from allusions to his
life in the letters (epistles) of the early Christian propagandists. The first
three gospels, the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, many suppose to be
derived from some earlier documents; the gospel of St. John has more
idiosyncrasy and is coloured by theology of a strongly Hellenic type. Critics
are disposed to regard the gospel of St. Mark as being the most trustworthy
account of the personality and actual words of Jesus. But all four agree in
giving us a picture of a very definite personality; they carry the same
conviction of reality that the early accounts of Buddha do. In spite of
miraculous and incredible additions, one is obliged to say, «Here was a man.
This part of the tale could not have been invented».

But just as the personality of Gautama Buddha has been
distorted and obscured by the stiff squatting figure, the gilded idol of later
Buddhism, so one feels that the lean and strenuous personality of Jesus is much
wronged by the unreality and conventionality that a mistaken reverence has
imposed upon his figure in modern Christian art. Jesus was a penniless teacher,
who wandered about the dusty sun-bit country of Judea, living upon casual gifts
of food; yet he is always represented clean, combed, and sleek, in spotless
raiment, erect, and with something motionless about him as though he was
gliding through the air. This alone has made him unreal and incredible to many
people who cannot distinguish the core of the story from the ornamental and
unwise additions of the unintelligently devout.

And it may be that the early parts of the gospels are
accretions of the same nature. The miraculous circumstances of the birth of
Jesus, the great star that brought wise men from the cast to worship at his
manger cradle, the massacre of the male infant children in the region of
Bethlehem by Herod as a consequence of these portents, and the flight into
Egypt, are all supposed to be such accretionary matter by many authorities. At
the best they are events unnecessary to the teaching, and they rob it of much
of the strength and power it possesses when we strip it of such accompaniment.
So, too, do the discrepant genealogies given by Matthew and Luke, in which
there is an endeavour to trace the direct descent of Joseph, his father, from
King David, as though it was any honour to Jesus or to anyone to have such a
man as an ancestor. The insertion of these genealogies is the more peculiar and
unreasonable, because, according to the legend, Jesus was not the son of Joseph
at all, but miraculously conceived.

We are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult
accessories, with the figure of a being, very human, very earnest and passionate,
capable of swift anger, and teaching a new, and simple and profound doctrine, namely,
the universal loving Fatherhood of God and the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven.
He was clearly a person, to use a common phrase, of intense personal magnetism.
He attracted followers and filled them with love and courage. Weak and ailing
people were heartened and healed by his presence. Yet he was probably of a
delicate physique, because of the swiftness with which he died under the pains
of crucifixion. There is a tradition that he fainted when, according to the
custom, he was made to bear his cross to the place of execution. When he first
appeared as a teacher he was a man of about thirty. He went about the country
for three years spreading his doctrine, and then he came to Jerusalem and was
accused of trying to set up a strange kingdom in Judea; he was tried upon this
charge, and crucified together with two thieves. Long before these two were
dead, his sufferings were over.

Now it is a matter of fact that in the gospels all that
body of theological assertion which constitutes Christianity finds little
support. There is, as the reader may see for himself, no clear and emphatic
assertion in these books of the doctrines which Christian teachers of all
denominations find generally necessary to salvation. Except for one or two
passages in St. John's Gospel it is difficult to get any words actually
ascribed to Jesus in which be claimed to be the Jewish Messiah (rendered in
Greek by «the Christ») and still more difficult is it to find any claim to be a
part of the godhead, or any passage in which he explained the doctrine of the
Atonement or urged any sacrifices or sacraments (that is to say, priestly
offices) upon his followers. We shall see presently how later on all Christendom
was torn by disputes about the Trinity. There is no evidence that the apostles
of Jesus ever heard of the Trinity, at any rate from him. The observance of the
Jewish Sabbath, again, transferred to the Mithraic Sun-day, is an important
feature of many Christian cults; but Jesus deliberately broke the Sabbath, and
said that it was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. Nor did he say a
word about the worship of his mother Mary in the guise of Isis, the Queen of
Heaven. All that is most characteristically Christian in worship and usage, he
ignored. Sceptical writers have had the temerity to deny that Jesus can be
called a Christian at all. For light upon these extraordinary gaps in his
teaching, each reader must go to his own religious guides. Here we are bound to
mention these gaps on account of the difficulties and controversies that arose
out of them, and we are equally bound not to enlarge upon them.

As remarkable is the enormous prominence given by Jesus to
the teaching of what he called the Kingdom of Heaven, and its comparative
insignificance in the procedure and teaching of most of the Christian churches.

This doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main
teaching of Jesus, and which plays so small a part in the Christian creeds, is
certainly one of the most revolutionary doctrines that ever stirred and changed
human thought. It is small wonder if, the world of that time failed to grasp
its full significance, and recoiled in dismay from even a half apprehension of
its tremendous challenges to the established habits and institutions of
mankind. It is small wonder if the hesitating convert and disciple presently
went back to the old familiar ideas of temple and altar, of fierce deity and
propitiatory observance, of consecrated priest and magic blessing, and these
things being attended to reverted then to the dear old habitual life of hates
and profits and competition and pride. For the doctrine of the Kingdom of
Heaven, as Jesus seems to have preached it, was no less than a bold and
uncompromising demand for a complete change and cleansing of the life of our
struggling race, an utter cleansing, without and within. To the gospels the
reader must go for all that is preserved of this tremendous teaching; here we
are only concerned with the jar of its impact upon established ideas.

The Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole
world, was a righteous god, but they also thought of him as a trading god who
had made a bargain with their Father Abraham about them, a very good bargain
indeed for them, to bring them at last to predominance in the earth. With
dismay and anger they heard Jesus sweeping away their dear securities. God, he
taught, was no bargainer; there were no chosen people and no favourites in the
Kingdom of Heaven. God was the loving father of all life, as incapable of
showing favour as the universal sun. And all men were brothers–sinners alike
and beloved sons alike–of this divine father. In the parable of the Good
Samaritan Jesus cast scorn upon that natural tendency we all obey, to glorify
our own people and to minimize the righteousness of other creeds and other
races. In the parable of the labourers he thrust aside the obstinate claim of
the Jews to have a sort of first mortgage upon God. All whom God takes into the
kingdom, he taught, God serves alike; there is no distinction in his treatment,
because there is no measure to his bounty. From all, moreover, as the parable
of the buried talent witnesses, and as the incident of the widow's mite
enforces, he demands the utmost. There are no privileges, no rebates, and no
excuses in the Kingdom of Heaven.

But it was not only the intense tribal patriotism of the
Jews that Jesus outraged. They were a people of intense family loyalty, and he
would have swept away all the narrow and restrictive family affections in the
great flood of the love of God. The whole Kingdom of Heaven was to be the
family of his followers. We are told that, «While he yet talked to the people,
behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without,
desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him,
Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand
towards his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For
whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my
brother, and sister, and mother».\ [#fn2]_ 

And not only did Jesus strike at patriotism and the bonds
of family loyalty in the name of God's universal fatherhood and the brotherhood
of all mankind, but it is clear that his teaching condemned all the gradations
of the economic system, all private wealth, and personal advantages. All men
belonged to the kingdom; all their possessions belonged to the kingdom; the
righteous life for all men, the only righteous life, was the service of God's
will with all that we had, with all that we were. Again and again he denounced
private riches and the reservation of any private life.

«And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one
running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I
may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good?
there is none good but one, that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not
commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud
not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master,
all these things have I observed from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved
him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever
thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
come, take up the cross, and follow me. And he was sad at that saying, and went
away grieved: for he had great possessions.

«And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his
disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
God! And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answered again,
and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to
enter into the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God».\ [#fn3]_ 

Moreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which
was to make all men one together in God, Jesus, had small patience for the
bargaining righteousness of formal religion. Another large part of his recorded
utterances is aimed against the meticulous observance of the rules of the pious
career. «Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes,
which came from Jerusalem. And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread
with defiled, that is to, say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. For the
Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding
the tradition of the elders. And when they come from the market, except they
wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to
hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables. Then the
Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the
tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? He answered and
said unto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,

    | «This people honoureth me with their lips,
    | «But their heart is far from me.
    | «Howbeit in vain do they worship me,
    | «Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
    | «For laying aside the commandment of God, ye, hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such things ye do. And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition».\ [#fn4]_

So too, we may note a score of places in which he flouted
that darling virtue of the formalist, the observance of the Sabbath.

It was not merely a moral and a social revolution that
Jesus proclaimed; it is clear from a score of indications that his teaching had
a political bent of the plainest sort. It is true that he said his kingdom was
not of this world, that it was in the hearts of men and not upon a throne; but
it is equally clear that wherever and in what measure his kingdom was set up in
the hearts of men, the outer world would be in that measure revolutionized and
made new.

Whatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may
have missed in his utterances, it is plain that they did not miss his resolve
to revolutionize the world. Some of the questions that were brought to Jesus
and the answers he gave enable us to guess at the drift of much of his
unrecorded teaching. The directness of his political attack is manifest by such
an incident as that of the coin

«And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
Herodians, to catch him in his words. And when they were come, they say unto
him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou
regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it
lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give?
But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a
penny, that I may see it. And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is
this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. And Jesus
answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to
God the things that are God's»\ [#fn5]_  which in view of all else that he had
taught, left very little of a man or his possessions for Caesar.

The whole tenor of the opposition to him and the
circumstances of his trial and execution show clearly that to his
contemporaries he seemed to propose plainly and did propose plainly to change
and fuse and enlarge all human life. But even his disciples did not grasp the
profound and comprehensive significance of that proposal. They were ridden by
the old Jewish dream of a king, a Messiah to overthrow the Hellenized Herods
and the Roman overlord, and restore the fabled glories of David. They
disregarded the substance of his teaching, plain and direct though it was;
evidently they thought it was merely his mysterious and singular way of setting
about the adventure that would at last put him on the throne of Jerusalem. They
thought he was just another king among the endless succession of kings, but of
a quasi-magic kind, and making quasi-magic profession of an impossible virtue.

«And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,
saying Master, we would that thou shouldest do, for us whatsoever we shall
desire. And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? They
said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the
other on thy left hand, in thy glory. But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not
what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with? And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said
unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the
baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: but to sit on my right
hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for
whom it is prepared. And when the ten heard it, they began to be much
displeased with James and John. But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto
them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise
lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But so
shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your
minister: and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to
give his life a ransom for many».\ [#fn6]_ 

This was cold comfort for those who looked for a due reward
for their services and hardships in his train. They could not believe this hard
doctrine of a kingdom of service which was its own exceeding great reward. Even
after his death upon the cross, they could still, after their first dismay,
revert to the belief that he was nevertheless in the vein of the ancient world
of pomps, and privileges, that presently by some amazing miracle he would
become undead again and return, and set up his throne with much splendour and
graciousness in Jerusalem. They thought his life was a stratagem and his death
a trick.

He was too great for his disciples. And in view of what he
plainly said, is it any wonder that all who were rich and prosperous felt a
horror of strange things, a swimming of their world at his teaching? Perhaps
the priests and the rulers and the rich men understood him better than his
followers. He was dragging out all the little private reservations they had
made from social service into the light of a universal religious life.

He was like some terrible moral huntsman digging mankind
out of the snug burrows in which they had lived hitherto. In the white blaze of
this kingdom of his there was to be no property, no privilege, no pride and
precedence; no motive indeed and no reward but love. Is it any wonder that men
were dazzled and blinded and cried out against him? Even his disciples cried
out when he would not spare them the light. Is it any wonder that the priests
realized that between this man and themselves there was no choice but that he
or priestcraft should perish? Is it any wonder that the Roman soldiers,
confronted and amazed by something soaring over their comprehension and
threatening all their disciplines, should take refuge in wild laughter, and
crown him with thorns and robe him in purple and make a mock Caesar of him? For
to take him seriously was to enter upon a strange and alarming life, to abandon
habits, to control instincts and impulses, to essay an incredible happiness. .

Is it any wonder that to this day this Galilean is too much
for our small hearts?
