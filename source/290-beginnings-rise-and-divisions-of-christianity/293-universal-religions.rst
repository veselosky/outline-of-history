29.3 The Universal Religions
========================================================================
Yet be it noted that while there was much in the real
teachings of Jesus that a rich man or a priest or a trader or an imperial
official or any ordinary respectable citizen could not accept without the most
revolutionary changes in his way of living, yet there was nothing that a
follower of the actual teaching of Gautama Sakya might not receive very
readily, nothing to prevent a primitive Buddhist from being also a Nazarene,
and nothing to prevent a personal disciple of Jesus from accepting all the
recorded teachings of Buddha.

Again consider the tone of this extract from the writings
of a Chinaman, Mo Ti, who lived somewhen in the fourth century B.C., - when the
doctrines of Confucius and Lao Tse prevailed in China, before the advent of
Buddhism to that country, and note how «Nazarene» it is.

«The mutual attacks of state on state; the mutual
usurpations, of family on family; the mutual robberies of man on man; the want
of kindness on the part of the sovereign and of loyalty on the part of the
minister; the want of tenderness and filial duty between father and son–these,
and such as these, are the things injurious to the empire. All this has arisen
from want of mutual love. If but that one virtue could be made universal, the
princes loving one another would have no battle-fields; the chiefs of families
would attempt no usurpations; men would commit no robberies; rulers and
ministers would be gracious and loyal; fathers and sons would be kind and
filial; brothers would be harmonious and easily reconciled. Men in general
loving one another, the strong would not make prey of the weak; the many would
not plunder the few, the rich would not insult the poor, the noble would not be
insolent to the mean; and the deceitful would not impose upon the simple».\ [#fn7]_ 

This is extraordinarily like the teaching of Jesus of
Nazareth cast into political terms. The thoughts of Mo Ti came close to the
Kingdom of Heaven.

This essential identity is the most important historical
aspect of these great world religions. They were in their beginnings quite
unlike the priest, altar, and temple cults, those cults for the worship of
definite finite gods that played so great and so essential a part in the
earlier stages of man's development between 15,000 B.C. and 600 B.C. These new
world religions, from 600 B.C. onward, were essentially religions of the heart and
of the universal sky. They swept away all those various and limited gods that
had served the turn of human needs since the first communities were welded
together by fear and hope. And presently when we come to Islam we shall find
that for a third time the same fundamental new doctrine of the need of a
universal devotion of all men to one Will reappears. Warned by the experiences
of Christianity, Muhammad was very emphatic in insisting that he himself was
merely a man and so saved his teaching from much corruption and
misrepresentation.

We speak of these great religions of mankind which arose
between the Persian conquest of Babylon and the break-up of the Roman empire as
rivals; but it is their defects, their accumulations and excrescences, their
differences of language and phrase, that cause the rivalry; and it is not to
one overcoming the other or to any new variant replacing them that we must
look, but to the white truth in each being burnt free from its dross, and
becoming manifestly the same truth–namely, that the hearts of men, and
therewith all the lives and institutions of men, must be subdued to one common
Will, ruling them all.\ [#fn8]_ 

And though much has been written foolishly about the
antagonism of science and religion, there is indeed no such antagonism. What
all these world religions declare by inspiration and insight, history as it
grows clearer and science as its range extends display, as a reasonable and
demonstrable fact, that men form one universal brotherhood, that they spring
from one common origin, that their individual lives, their nations and races,
interbreed and blend and go on to merge again at last in one common human
destiny upon this little planet amidst the stars. And the psychologist can now
stand beside the preacher and assure us that there is no reasoned peace of
heart, no balance and no safety in the soul, until a man in losing his life has
found it, and has schooled and disciplined his interests and will beyond
greeds, rivalries, fears, instincts, and narrow affections. The history of our
race and personal religious experience run so closely parallel as to seem to a
modern observer almost the same thing; both tell of a being at first scattered
and blind and utterly confused, feeling its way slowly to the serenity and
salvation of an ordered and coherent purpose. That, in the simplest, is the
outline of history; whether one have a religious purpose or disavow a religious
purpose altogether, the lines of the outline remain the same.
