29.4 The Crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth
========================================================================
In the year 30 A.D., while Tiberius, the second emperor,
was Emperor of Rome and Pontius Pilate was procurator of Judea, a little while
before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus of Nazareth came into Jerusalem.
Probably he came then for the first time. Hitherto he had been preaching
chiefly in Galilee, and for the most part round and about the town of
Capernaum. In Capernaum be had preached in the synagogue.

His entry into Jerusalem was a pacific triumph. He had
gathered a great following in Galilee – he had sometimes to preach from a boat
upon the Lake of Galilee, because of the pressure of the crowd upon the shore–and
his fame had spread before him to the capital.

Great crowds came out to greet him. It is clear they did
not understand the drift of his teaching, and that they shared the general
persuasion that by some magic of righteousness he was going to overthrow the
established order. He rode into the city upon the foal of an ass that had been
borrowed by his disciples. The crowd accompanied him with cries of triumph and
shouts of «Hosanna», a word of rejoicing.

He went to the temple. Its outer courts were cumbered with
the tables of money-changers and with the stalls of those who sold doves to be
liberated by pious visitors to the temple. These traders upon religion he and
his followers cast out, overturning the tables. It was almost his only act of
positive rule.

Then for a week he taught in Jerusalem, surrounded by a
crowd of followers who made his arrest by the authorities difficult. Then
officialdom gathered itself together against this astonishing intruder. One of
his disciples, Judas, dismayed and disappointed at the apparent ineffectiveness
of this capture of Jerusalem, went to the Jewish priests to give them his
advice and help in the arrest of Jesus. For this service he was rewarded with
thirty pieces of silver. The high priest and the Jews generally had many
reasons for dismay at this gentle insurrection that was filling the streets
with excited crowds; for example, the Romans might misunderstand it or use it as
an occasion to do some mischief to the whole Jewish people. Accordingly the
high priest Caiaphas, in his anxiety to show his loyalty to the Roman overlord,
was the leader in the proceedings against this unarmed Messiah, and the priests
and the orthodox mob of Jerusalem the chief accusers of Jesus.

How he was arrested in the garden of Gethsemane, how he was
tried and sentenced by Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator, how he was
scourged and mocked by the Roman soldiers and crucified upon the hill called Golgotha,
is told with unsurpassable simplicity and dignity in the gospels.

The revolution collapsed utterly. The disciples of Jesus
with one accord deserted him, and Peter, being taxed as one of them, said, «I
know not the man». This was not the end they had anticipated in their great
coming to Jerusalem. His last hours of aching pain and thirst upon the cross
were watched only by a few women and near friends. Towards the end of the long
day of suffering this abandoned leader roused himself to one supreme effort,
cried out with a loud voice, «My God! my God! why has thou forsaken me?» and,
leaving these words to echo down the ages, a perpetual riddle, to the faithful,
died.

It was inevitable that simple believers should have tried
to enhance the stark terrors of this tragedy by foolish stories of physical
disturbances similar to those which had been invented to emphasize the
conversion of Gautama. We are told that a great darkness fell upon the earth,
and that the veil of the temple was rent in twain; but if indeed these things
occurred, they produced not the slightest effect upon the minds of people in
Jerusalem at that time. It is difficult to believe nowadays that the order of
nature indulged in any such meaningless comments. Far more tremendous is it to suppose
a world apparently indifferent to those three crosses in the red evening
twilight, and to the little group of perplexed and desolated watchers. The
darkness closed upon the hill; the distant city set about its preparations for
the Passover; scarcely anyone but that knot of mourners on the way to their
homes troubled whether Jesus of Nazareth was still dying or already dead. . . .

The souls of the disciples were plunged for a time into
utter darkness. Then presently came a whisper among them and stories, rather
discrepant stories, that the body of Jesus was not in the tomb in which it had
been placed, and that first one and then another had seen him alive. Soon they
were consoling themselves with the conviction that he had risen from the dead,
that he had shown himself to many, and had ascended visibly into heaven.
Witnesses were found to declare that they had positively seen him go up,
visibly in his body. He had gone through the blue to God. Soon they had
convinced themselves that he would presently come again, in power and glory, to
judge all mankind. In a little while, they said, he would come back to them;
and in these bright revivals of their old-time dream of an assertive and
temporal splendour they forgot the greater measure, the giant measure, he had
given them of the Kingdom of God.
