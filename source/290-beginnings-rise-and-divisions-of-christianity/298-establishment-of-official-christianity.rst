29.8 The Establishment of Official Christianity
========================================================================
This date 325 A.D. is a very convenient date in our
history. It is the date of the first complete general («ecumenical») council of
the entire Christian world. (That at Arles we have mentioned had been a
gathering of only the western half.) It marks the definite entry upon the stage
of human affairs of the Christian church and of Christianity as it is generally
understood in the world today. It marks the exact definition of Christian
teaching by the Nicene Creed.

It is necessary that we should recall the reader's
attention to the profound differences between this fully developed Christianity
of Nicaea and the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. All Christians hold that the latter
is completely contained in the former, but that is a question outside our
province. What is clearly apparent is that the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth
was a *prophetic teaching* of the new
type that began with the Hebrew prophets. It was not priestly; it had no
consecrated temple and no altar. It had no rites and ceremonies. Its sacrifice
was «a broken and a contrite heart». Its only organization was an organization
of preachers, and its chief function was the sermon. But the fully-fledged
Christianity of the fourth century, though it preserved as its nucleus the
teachings of Jesus in the gospels, was mainly a 
*priestly religion* of a type already familiar to the world for
thousand of years. The centre of its elaborate ritual was an altar, and the
essential act of worship the sacrifice, by a consecrated priest, of the mass.
And it had a rapidly developing organization of deacons, priests, and bishops.

But if Christianity had taken on an extraordinary outward
resemblance to the cults of Serapis, Ammon, or Bel-Marduk, we must remember
that even its priestcraft had certain novel features. Nowhere did it possess
any quasi-divine image of God. There was no bead temple containing the god,
because God was everywhere. There was no holy of holies. Its widespread altars
were all addressed to the unseen universal Trinity. Even in its most archaic
aspects there was in Christianity something new.

A very important thing for us to note is the role played by
the Emperor in the fixation of Christianity. Not only was council of Nicaea
assembled by Constantine the Great, but all the great councils, the two at
Constantinople (381 and 553), Ephesus (431), and Chalcedon (451), were called
together by the imperial power. And it is very manifest that in much of the history
of Christianity at this time the spirit of Constantine the Great is as evident
as, or more evident, than the spirit of Jesus. He was, we have said, a pure
autocrat. The last vestiges of Roman republicanism had vanished in the days of
Aurelian and Diocletian. To the best of his lights he was trying to remake the
crazy empire while there was yet time, and he worked without any councillors,
any public opinion, or any sense of the need of such aids and checks. The idea
of stamping out all controversy and division, stamping out all thought, by
imposing one dogmatic creed upon all believers, is an altogether autocratic
idea, it is the idea of the single handed man who feels that to work at all he
must be free from opposition and criticism. The history of the Church under his
influence becomes now therefore a history of the violent struggles that were
bound to follow upon his sudden and rough summons to unanimity. From him the
Church acquired the disposition to be authoritative and unquestioned, to
develop a centralized organization and run parallel to the empire.

A second great autocrat who presently contributed to the
stamping upon Catholic Christianity of a distinctly authoritative character was
Theodosius I, Theodosius the Great (379-395) He forbade the unorthodox to hold meetings,
handed over all churches to the Trinitarians, and overthrew the heathen
temples, throughout the empire, and in 390 he caused the great statue of
Serapis at Alexandria to be destroyed. There was to be no rivalry, no
qualification to the rigid unity of the Church.

Here we cannot tell of the vast internal troubles of the
Church, its indigestions of heresy; of Arians and Paulicians, of Gnostics and
Manicheans. Had it been less authoritative find more tolerant of intellectual
variety, it might perhaps have been a still more powerful body than it became.
But, in spite of all these disorders, it did for some time maintain a
conception of human unity more intimate and far wider than was ever achieved
before. By the fifth century Christendom was already becoming sturdier, and
more enduring in than any empire had ever been, because it was something not
merely imposed upon men, but interwoven with the texture of their minds. It
reached out far beyond the utmost limits of the empire, into Armenia, Persia,
Abyssinia, Ireland, Germany, India, and Turkestan. «Though made up of widely
scattered congregations, it was thought of as one body of Christ, one people of
God. This ideal unity found expression in many ways. Intercommunication between
the various Christian communities was very active. Christians upon a journey
were always sure of a warm welcome and hospitable entertainment from their
fellow-disciples. Messengers and letters were sent freely from one church to
another. Missionaries and evangelists went continually from place to place.
Documents of various kinds, including gospels and apostolic epistles,
circulated widely. Thus in various ways the feeling of unity found expression,
and the development of widely separated parts of Christendom conformed more or
less closely to a common type».\ [#fn12]_ 

Christendom retained at least the formal tradition of this
general unity of spirit until 1054, when the Latin-speaking Western church and
the main and original Greek-speaking church, the «Orthodox» church severed
themselves from one another, ostensibly upon the question of adding two words
to the creed. The older creed had declared that the «Holy Ghost proceeded from
the Father». The Latins wanted to add, and did add 
*«Filioque»* (= and from the son), and placed the Greeks out of their
communion because they would not follow this lead. But already as early as the
fifth century the Christians in Eastern Syria, Persia, Central Asia–there were
churches at Merv, Herat, and Samarkand–and India had detached themselves on a
similar score. These extremely interesting Asiatic Christians are known in
history as the Nestorian Church, and their influence extended into China. The
Egyptian and Abyssinian churches also detached themselves very early upon
similarly inexplicable points. Long before this formal separation of the Latin
and Greek-speaking halves of the main church, however, there was a practical
separation following upon the breaking up of the empire. Their conditions
diverged from the first. While the Greek-speaking Eastern Empire held together
and the emperor at Constantinople remained dominant in the Church, the Latin
half of the empire, as we have already told, collapsed, and left the Church
free of any such imperial control. Moreover, while ecclesiastical authority in
the empire of Constantinople was divided between the high-bishops, or
patriarchs, of Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, authority in
the West was concentrated in the Patriarch, or Pope, of Rome. The Bishop of
Rome had always been recognized as first among the patriarchs, and all these
things conspired to justify exceptional pretensions upon his part to a
quasi-imperial authority. With the final fall of the Western Empire he took
over the ancient title of *pontifex
maximus* which the emperors had held, and so became the supreme sacrificial
priest of the Roman tradition. Over the Christians of the West his supremacy
was fully recognized, but from the beginning it had to be urged with discretion
within the dominions of the Eastern emperor and the jurisdictions of the other
four patriarchs.

Ideas of worldly rule by the Church were already prevalent
in the fourth century. St. Augustine, a citizen of Hippo in North Africa, who
wrote between 354 and 430, gave expression to the developing political ideas of
the Church in his book :t:`The City of God`.
:t:`The City of God` leads the mind very directly towards the possibility of
making the world into a theological and organized Kingdom of Heaven. The city,
as Augustine puts it, is «a spiritual society of the predestined faithful» but
the step from that to a political application was not a very wide one. The
Church was to be the ruler of the world over all nations, the divinely led
ruling power over a great league of terrestrial states. In later years these
ideas developed into a definite political theory and policy. As the barbarian
races settled and became Christian, the Pope began to claim an overlordship of
their kings. In a few centuries the Pope had become in theory, and to a certain
extent in practice, the high priest, censor, judge, and divine monarch of
Christendom; his influence extended in the west far beyond the utmost range of
the old empire, to Ireland, Norway and Sweden, and over all Germany. For more
than a thousand years this idea of the unity of Christendom, of Christendom as
a sort of vast Amphictyony, whose members even in war time were restrained from
many extremities by the idea of a common brotherhood and a common loyalty to
the Church, dominated Europe. The history of Europe from the fifth century
onward to the fifteenth is very largely the history of the failure of this
great idea of a divine world to
realize itself in practice.
