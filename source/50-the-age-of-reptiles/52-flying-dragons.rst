5.2 Flying Dragons
====================

One special development of the dinosaurian type of reptile was a light,
hopping, climbing group of creatures which developed a bat-like web between
the fifth finger and the side of the body, which was used in gliding from
tree to tree after the fashion of the flying squirrels. These bat-lizards
were the *Pterodactyls.* They are often described as *flying* reptiles, and
pictures are drawn of Mesozoic scenery in which they are seen soaring and
swooping about. But their breastbone has no keel such as the breastbone of a
bird has for the attachment of muscles strong enough for long sustained
flying. They must have flitted about like bats. They must have had a
grotesque resemblance to heraldic dragons, and they played the part of bat-
like birds in the Mesozoic jungles. But bird-like though they were, they were
not birds nor the ancestors of birds. The structure of their wings was
altogether different from that of birds. The structure of their wings was
that of a hand with one long finger and a web; the wing of a bird is like an
arm with feathers projecting from its hind edge. And, these Pterodactyls had
no feathers.
