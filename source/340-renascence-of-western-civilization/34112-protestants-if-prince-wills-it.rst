34.11.2 Protestants if the Prince Wills it
========================================================================
Ferdinand, the brother of Charles V, took over his abandoned work and met the
German princes at the diet of Augsburg in 1555. Again there was an attempt to
establish a religious peace. Nothing could better show the quality of that
attempted settlement and the blindness of the princes and statesmen concerned in
it, to the deeper and broader processes of the time, than the form that
settlement took. The recognition of religious freedom was to apply to the states
and not to individual citizens; cujus *regio ejus religio, «the confession of
the subject was to be dependent on that of the territorial
lord».'*
