21.4 The Kingdom of Lydia
========================================================================
We have had occasion to mention the kingdom of Lydia, and
it may be well to give a short note here upon the Lydians before proceeding
with our story. The original population of the larger part of Asia Minor may
perhaps have been akin to the original population of Greece and Crete. If so,
it was of «Mediterranean» race. Or it may have been another branch of those
still more generalized and fundamental darkish peoples from whom arose the
Mediterranean race to the west and the Dravidians to the east. Remains of the
same sort of art that distinguishes Cnossos and Mycenae are to be found
scattered over Asia Minor. But just as the Nordic Greeks poured southward into
Greece to conquer and mix with the aborigines, so did other and kindred Nordic
tribes pour over the Bosphorus into Asia Minor. Over some areas these Aryan
peoples prevailed altogether, and became the bulk of the inhabitants and
retained their Aryan speech. Such were the Phrygians, a people whose language
was almost as close to that of the Greeks as the Macedonian. But over other
areas the Aryans did not so prevail. In Lydia the original race and their
language held their own. The Lydians were a non-Aryan people speaking a
non-Aryan speech, of which at the present time only a few words are known.
Their capital city was Sardis.

Their religion was also non-Aryan. They worshipped a Great
Mother goddess. The Phrygians also, though retaining their Greek-like language,
became infected with mysterious religion, and much of the mystical religion and
secret ceremonial that pervaded Athens at a later date was Phrygian (when not
Thracian) in origin.

At first the Lydians held the western sea-coast of Asia
Minor, but they were driven back from it by the establishment of Ionian Greeks
coming by the sea and founding cities. Later on, however, these Ionian Greek
cities were brought into subjection by the Lydian kings.

The history of this country is not clearly known, and were
it known it would scarcely be of sufficient importance to be related in this
historical outline, but in the eighth century B.C. one monarch, named Gyges,
becomes noteworthy. The country under his rule was subjected to another Aryan
invasion; certain nomadic tribes called the Cimmerians came pouring across Asia
Minor, and they were driven back with difficulty by Gyges and his son and
grandson. Sardis was twice taken and burnt by these barbarians. And it is on
record that Gyges paid tribute to Sardanapalus, which serves to link him up
with our general ideas of the history of Assyria, Israel, and Egypt. Later
Gyges rebelled against Assyria, and sent, troops to help Psammetichus I to
liberate Egypt from its brief servitude to the Assyrians.

It was Alyattes, the grandson of Gyges, who made Lydia into
a considerable power. He reigned for seven years, and he reduced most of the
Ionian cities of Asia Minor to subjection. The country became the centre of a
great trade between Asia and Europe; it had always been productive and rich in
gold, and now the Lydian monarch was reputed the richest in Asia. There was a
great coming and going between the Black and Mediterranean Seas, and between
the East and West. We have already noted that Lydia was reputed to be the first
country in the world to produce coined money, and to provide the convenience of
inns for travellers and traders. The Lydian dynasty seems to have been a
trading dynasty of the type of Minos in Crete, with a banking and financial
development. . . . So much we may note of Lydia by way of preface to the next
section.
