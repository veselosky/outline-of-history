21.10 Plataea and Mycale
========================================================================
The rest of the Persian army remained in Thessaly under the
command of Mardonius, and for a year he maintained an aggressive campaign
against the Greeks. Finally, he was defeated and killed in a pitched battle at
Plataea (479 BC.), and on the same day the Persian fleet and a land army met
with joint disaster under the shadow of Mount Mycale on the Asiatic mainland,
between Ephesus and Miletus. The Persian ships, being in fear of the Greeks,
had been drawn up on shore and a wall built about them; but the Greeks
disembarked and stormed this enclosure. They then sailed to the, Hellespont to
destroy what was left of the bridge of boats, so that later the Persian
fugitives, retreating from Plataea, had to cross by shipping at the Bosphorus,
and did so with difficulty.

Encouraged by these disasters of the imperial power, says
Herodotus, the Ionian cities in Asia began for a second time to revolt against
the Persians.

With this the ninth, book of the 
:t:`History of Herodotus` comes to an end. He was born about 484 B.C.,
so, that at the time of the battle of Plataea he was a child of five-years old.
Much of the substance of his story was gathered by him from actors in and
eye-witnesses of, the great events he relates. The war still dragged on for a
long time; the Greeks supported a rebellion against Persian rule in Egypt, and
tried unsuccessfully to take Cyprus; it did not end until about 449 B.C. Then
the Greek coasts of Asia Minor and the Greek cities in the Black Sea remained
generally free, but Cyprus and Egypt continued under Persian rule. Herodotus,
who had been born a Persian subject in the Ionian city of Halicarnassus, was
five and thirty years old by that time, and he must have taken an early
opportunity after this peace of visiting Babylon and Persia. He probably went
to Athens, with his History ready to recite, about 438 B.C.

The idea of a great union of Greece for aggression against
Persia was not altogether strange to Herodotus. Some of his readers suspect him
of writing to enforce it. It was certainly in the air at that time. He describes
Aristagoras, the son-in-law of Histiaeus, as showing the Spartans «a tablet of
bronze on which was engraved a map of the whole earth with all the seas and
rivers». He makes Aristagoras say: «These Barbarians are not valiant in fight.
You, on the other hand, have now attained to the utmost skill in war. They
fight with bows and arrows and a short spear: they go into battle wearing
trousers and having caps on their heads. You have perfected your weapons and
discipline. They are easily to be conquered. Not all the other nations of the
world have what they possess; gold, silver, bronze, embroidered garments,
beasts and slaves; *all this you might
have for yourselves, if you so desired».*

It was a hundred years before these suggestions bore fruit.

Xerxes was murdered in his palace about 465 B.C., and
thereafter Persia made no further attempts at conquest in Europe. We have no
such knowledge of the things that were happening in the empire of the Great
King as we have of the occurrences in the little states of Central Greece.
Greece had suddenly begun to produce literature, and put itself upon record as
no other nation had ever done hitherto. After 479 B.C. (Plataea) the spirit
seems to have gone out of the government of the Medes and Persians. The empire
of the Great King enters upon a period of decay. An Artaxerxes, a second
Xerxes, a second Darius, pass across the stage; there are rebellions in Egypt
and Syria; the Medes rebel; a second Artaxerxes and a second Cyrus, his
brother, fight for the throne. This history is even as the history of
Babylonia, Assyria, and Egypt in the older times. It is autocracy reverting to
its normal state of palace crime, blood-stained magnificence, and moral
squalor. But the last-named struggle produced a Greek masterpiece, for this second
Cyrus collected an army of Greek mercenaries and marched into Babylonia, and
was there killed at the moment of victory over Artaxerxes II. Thereupon, the
Ten Thousand Greeks, left with no one to employ them, made a retreat to the
coast again (401 B.C.), and this retreat was immortalized in a book, one of the
first of personal war books, the *Anabasis,*
by their leader Xenophon.

Murders, revolts, chastisements, disasters, cunning
alliances, and base betrayals, and no Herodotus to record them. Such is the texture
of Persian history. An Artaxerxes III, covered with blood, flourishes, dimly
for a time. «Artaxerxes III is said to have been murdered by Bagoas, who places
Arses, the youngest of the king's sons, on the throne only to slay him in turn
when he seemed to be contemplating independent
action».\ [#fn6]_  So it goes on.

Athens, prospering for a time after the Persian repulse,
was smitten by the plague in which Pericles, its greatest ruler, died (428
B.C.). But, as a noteworthy fact amidst these confusions, the Ten Thousand of
Xenophon were scattering now among the Greek cities, repeating from their own
experience the declaration of Aristagoras that the Persian empire was a rich
confusion which it would be very easy for resolute men to conquer.
