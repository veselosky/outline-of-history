But one monarch in the world was alive to the threat of the
new power that lay in the hands of Cyrus. This was Croesus, the Lydian king.
His son had been killed in a very tragic manner, which Herodotus relates, but
which we will not describe here. Says Herodotus:

    «For two years then, Croesus remained quiet in great
    mourning, because he was deprived of his son; but after this period of time,
    the overthrowing of the rule of the son of Cyaxares by Cyrus, and the growing
    greatness of the Persians, caused Croesus to cease from his mourning, and led
    him to a care of cutting short the power of the Persians if by any means he
    might, while yet it was in growth and before they should have become great».

He then made trial of the various oracles.

    «To the Lydians who were to carry these gifts to the
    temples Croesus gave charge that they should ask the Oracles this question:
    whether Croesus should march against the Persians, and, if so, whether he
    should join with himself any army of men as his friends. And when the Lydians
    had arrived at the places to which they had been sent and had dedicated the
    votive offerings, they inquired of the Oracles, and said: 'Croesus, king of the
    Lydians and of other nations, considering that these are the only true Oracles
    among men, presents to you gifts such as your revelations deserve, and asks you
    again now whether he shall march against the Persians, and, if so, whether he
    shall join with himself any army of men as allies.' They inquired thus, and the
    answers of both the Oracles agreed in one, declaring to Croesus that if he
    should march against the Persians he should destroy a great empire. . . . So
    when the answers were brought back and Croesus heard them, he was delighted
    with the Oracles, and expecting that he would certainly destroy the kingdom of
    Cyrus, he sent again to Pytho, and presented to the men of Delphi, having
    ascertained the number of them, two staters of gold for each man: and in return
    for this the Delphians gave to Croesus and to the Lydians precedence in
    consulting the Oracle and freedom from all payments, and the right to front
    seats at the games, with this privilege also for all time, that any one of them
    who wished should be allowed to become a citizen of Delphi».

So Croesus made a defensive alliance both with the
Lacedemonians and the Egyptians. And Herodotus continues, 

    «while Croesus was
    preparing to march against the Persians, one of the Lydians, who even before
    this time was thought to be a wise man, but in consequence of this opinion got
    a very great name for wisdom among the Lydians, advised Croesus as follows: '0
    king, thou art preparing to march against men who wear breeches of leather, and
    the rest of their clothing is of leather also; and they eat food not such as
    they desire, but such as they can obtain, dwelling in a land which is rugged;
    and, moreover, they make no use of wine but drink water; and no figs have they
    for dessert, nor any other good thing. On the one hand, if thou shalt overcome
    them, what wilt thou take away from them, seeing they have nothing and, on the
    other hand, if thou shalt be overcome, consider how many good things thou wilt
    lose; for once having tasted our good things, they will cling to them fast, and
    it will not be possible to drive them away. I, for my own part, feel gratitude
    to the gods that they do not put it into the minds of the Persians to march
    against the Lydians.' Thus he spoke not persuading Croesus; for it is true
    indeed that the Persians before they subdued the Lydians had no luxury nor any
    good thing».

Croesus and Cyrus fought an indecisive battle at Pteria,
from which Croesus retreated. Cyrus followed him up, and he gave battle outside
his capital town of Sardis. The chief strength of the Lydians lay in their
cavalry; they were excellent, if undisciplined, horsemen, and fought with long
spears.

    «Cyrus, when he saw the Lydians being arrayed for battle,
    fearing their horsemen, did on the suggestion of Harpagos, a Mede, as follows:
    All the camels which were in the train of his army carrying provisions and
    baggage he gathered together and he took off their burdens and set men upon
    them provided with the equipment of cavalry; and, having thus, furnished them,
    forth be appointed them to go in front of the rest of the army towards the
    horsemen of Croesus; and after the camel-troop he ordered the infantry to
    follow; and behind the infantry he placed his whole force of cavalry. Then,
    when all his men had been placed in their several positions, he charged them to
    spare none of the other Lydians, slaying all who might come in their way, but
    Croesus himself they were not to slay, not even if be should make resistance
    when he was being captured. Such was his charge: and be set the camels opposite
    the horsemen for this reason–because the horse has a fear of the camel and
    cannot endure either to see his form or to scent his smell: for this reason
    then the trick, had been devised, in order that the cavalry of Croesus might be
    useless, that very force wherewith the Lydian king was expecting most to shine.
    And as they were coming together to the battle, so soon as the horses scented
    the camels and saw them, they turned away back, and the hopes of Croesus were
    at once brought to nought».

In fourteen days Sardis was stormed and Croesus taken
prisoner. . . .

    «So the Persians having taken him brought him into the
    presence of Cyrus; and be piled up a great pyre and caused Croesus to go up
    upon it bound in fetters, and along with him twice seven sons of Lydians, whether
    it was that he meant to dedicate this offering as first-fruits of his victory
    to some god, or whether be desired to fulfil a vow, or else had heard that
    Croesus was a god-fearing man, and so caused him to go up on the pyre because
    he wished to know if any one of the divine powers would save him, so that he
    should not be burnt alive. He, they say, did this; but to Croesus as he stood
    upon the pyre there came, although he was in such evil ease, a memory of the
    saying of Solon, how he had said with divine inspiration that no one of the
    living might be called happy. And when this thought came into his mind, they
    say that he sighed deeply and groaned aloud, having been for long silent, and
    three times he uttered the name of Solon. Hearing this, Cyrus bade the
    interpreters ask Croesus who was this person on whom he called; and they came
    near and asked. And Croesus for a time, it is said, kept silence when he was
    asked this, but afterwards, being pressed, he said: 'One whom more than much
    wealth I should have desired to have speech with all monarchs.' Then, since his
    words were of doubtful import, they asked again of that which he said; and as
    they were urgent with him and gave him no peace, he told how once Solon, an
    Athenian, had come and having inspected all his wealth had made light of it,
    with such and such words; and how all had turned out for him according as Solon
    had said, not speaking at all especially with a view to Croesus himself, but
    with a view to the whole human race, and especially those who seem to
    themselves to be happy men. And while Croesus related these things, already the
    pyre was lighted and the edges of it round about were burning. Then they say
    that Cyrus, hearing from the interpreters what Croesus had said, changed his
    purpose and considered that he himself also was but a man, and that he was
    delivering another man, who had been not inferior to himself in felicity, alive
    to the fire; and, moreover, he feared the requital, and reflected that there
    was nothing of that which men possessed which was secure; therefore, they say,
    he ordered them to extinguish as quickly as possible the fire that was burning,
    and to bring down Croesus and those who were with him from the pyre; and they,
    using endeavours, were not able now to get the mastery of the flames. Then it
    is related by the Lydians that Croesus, having learned how Cyrus had changed
    his mind, and seeing that every one was trying to put out the fire, but that
    they were no longer able to check it, cried aloud, entreating Apollo that if
    any gift had ever been given by him which was acceptable to the god, he would
    come to his aid and rescue him from the evil which was now upon him. So he with
    tears entreated the god, and suddenly, they say, after clear sky and calm
    weather clouds gathered and a storm burst, and it rained with a very violent
    shower, and the pyre was extinguished.

    «Then Cyrus, having perceived that Croesus was a lover of
    the gods and a good man, caused him to be brought down from the pyre and asked
    him as follows: 'Croesus, tell me who of all men was it who persuaded thee to
    march upon my land and so to become an enemy to me instead of a friend?' And be
    said: '0 king, I did this to thy felicity and to my own misfortune, and the
    causer of this was the god of the Hellenes, who incited me to march with my
    army. For no one is so senseless as to choose of his own will war rather than
    peace, since in peace the sons bury their fathers, but in war the fathers bury
    their sons. But it was pleasing, I suppose, to the divine powers that these things
    should come to pass thus.'»

So Croesus became a councillor of Cyrus, and lived in
Babylon. When Lydia was subdued, Cyrus turned his attention to Nabonidus in
Babylon. He defeated the Babylonian army, under Belshazzar, outside Babylon,
and then laid siege to the town. He entered the town (538 B.C.), probably as we
have already suggested, with the connivance of the priests of Bel.
