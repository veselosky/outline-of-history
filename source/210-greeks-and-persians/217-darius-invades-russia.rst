21.7 Darius Invades Russia
========================================================================
Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses, who took an army
into Egypt (525 B.C.). There was a battle in the delta, in which Greek
mercenaries fought on both sides. Herodotus declares that he saw the bones of
the slain still lying on the field fifty or sixty years later, and comments on
the comparative thinness of the Persian skulls. After this battle Cambyses took
Memphis and most of Egypt.

In Egypt, we are told, Cambyses went mad. He took great
liberties with the Egyptian temples, and remained at Memphis «opening ancient
tombs and examining the dead bodies». He had already murdered both Croesus
ex-king of Lydia, and his own brother Smerdis before coming to Egypt, and he
died in Syria on the way back to Susa of an accidental wound, leaving no heirs
to succeed him. He was presently succeeded by Darius the Mede (521 B.C.), the
son of Hystaspes, one of the chief councillors of Cyrus.

The empire of Darius I was larger than any one of the
preceding empires whose growth we have traced. It included all Asia Minor and
Syria, that is to say, the ancient Lydian and Hittite empires, all the old
Assyrian and Babylonian empires, Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian regions,
Media, Persia, and it extended, perhaps, into India to the Indus. The nomadic
Arabians alone of all the peoples of what is nowadays called the Near East, did
not pay tribute to the satraps, (provincial governors) of Darius. The
organization of this great empire seems to have been on a much higher level of
efficiency than any of its precursors. Great arterial roads joined province to
province, and there was a system of royal
posts;\ [#fn5]_  at stated intervals post
horses stood always ready to carry the government messenger, or the traveller
if he had a government permit, on to the next stage of his journey. Apart from
this imperial right-of-way and the payment of tribute, the local governments
possessed a very considerable amount of local freedom. They were restrained
from internecine, conflict, which was all to their own good. And at first the
Greek cities of the mainland of Asia paid the tribute and shared in this
Persian Peace.

Darius was first incited to attack the Greeks in Europe by
a homesick Greek physician at his court, who wanted at any cost to be back in
Greece. Darius had already made plans for an expedition into Europe, aiming not
at Greece, but to the northward of Greece, across the Bosphorus and Danube. He
wanted to strike at South Russia, which he believed to be the home country of
the Scythian nomads who threatened him on his northern and north-eastern
frontiers. But he lent an attentive ear to the tempter, and sent agents into
Greece.

This great expedition of Darius opens out our view in this
history. It lifts a curtain upon the Balkan country behind Greece about which
we have said nothing hitherto; it carries us to and over the Danube. The
nucleus of his army marched from Susa, gathering up contingents as they made
their way to the Bosphorus. Here Greek allies (Ionian Greeks from Asia) had
made a bridge of boats, and the army crossed over while the Greek allies sailed
on in their ships to the Danube, and, two days' sail up from its mouth, landed
to make another floating bridge. Meanwhile, Darius and his host advanced along
the coast of what is now Bulgaria, but which was then called Thrace. They
crossed the Danube, and prepared to give battle to the Scythian army and take
the cities of the Scythians.

    The Empire of Darius (tribute-paying countries) at its greatest extent. The Arabs, says Herodotus, paid Darius a tribute of 1,000 talents of frankincense. The length of the great road from Sardis to Susa, across Armenia, would be over 1,600 miles.

But the Scythians had no cities, and they evaded a battle,
and the war degenerated into a tedious and hopeless pursuit of more mobile
enemies. Wells were stopped up and pastures destroyed by the nomads. The
Scythian horsemen hung upon the skirts of the great army, which consisted
mostly of foot soldiers, picking off stragglers and preventing foraging; and
they did their best to persuade the Ionian Greeks, who had made and were
guarding the bridge across the Danube, to break up the bridge, and so ensure
the destruction of Darius. So long as Darius continued to advance, however, the
loyalty of his Greek allies remained unshaken.

But privation, fatigue, and sickness hindered and crippled
the Persian army; Darius lost many stragglers and consumed his supplies, and at
last the melancholy conviction dawned upon him that a retreat across the Danube
was necessary to save him from complete exhaustion and defeat.

In order to get a start in his retreat he sacrificed his
sick and wounded. He had these men informed that he was about to attack the
Scythians at nightfall, and under this pretence stole out of the camp with the
pick of his troops and made off southward, leaving the camp fires burning and
the usual noises and movements of the camp behind him. Next day the men left in
the camp realized the trick their monarch had played upon them, and surrendered
themselves to the mercy of the Scythians; but Darius had got his start, and was
able to reach the bridge of boats before his pursuers came upon him. They were
more mobile than his troops, but they missed their quarry in the darkness. At
the river the retreating Persians «were brought to an extremity of fear», for
they found the, bridge partially broken down and its northern end destroyed.

At this point a voice echoes down the centuries to us. We
see a group of dismayed Persians standing about the Great King upon the bank of
the streaming river; we see the masses of halted troops, hungry and war-worn; a
trail of battered transport stretches away towards the horizon, upon which at
any time the advance guards of the pursuers may appear. There is not much noise
in spite of the multitude, but rather an inquiring silence. Standing out like a
pier from the further side of the great stream are the remains of the bridge of
boats, an enigma. . . . We cannot discern whether there are men over there or
not. The shipping of the Ionian Greeks seems still to be drawn up on the
further shore, but it is all very far away.

«Now there was with Darius an Egyptian who had a voice
louder than that of any other man on earth, and this man Darius ordered to take
his stand upon the bank of the Ister (Danube) and to call Histiaeus of
Miletus».

This worthy–a day is to come, as we shall presently tell,
when his decapitated head will be sent to Darius at Susa appears approaching
slowly across the waters in a boat.

There is a parley, and we gather that it is «all right».

The explanation Histiaeus has to make is a complicated one.
Some Scythians have been and have gone again. Scouts, perhaps, these were. It
would seem there had been a discussion between the Scythians and the Greeks.
The Scythians wanted the bridge broken down; they would then, they said,
undertake to finish up the Persian army and make an end of Darius and his
empire, and the Ionian Greeks of Asia could then free their cities again.
Miltiades, the Athenian, was for accepting this proposal. But Histiaeus had
been more subtle. He would prefer, he said, to see the Persians completely
destroyed before definitely abandoning their cause. Would the Scythians go back
and destroy the Persians to make sure of them while the Greeks on their part
destroyed the bridge? Anyhow, whichever side the Greeks took finally, it was
clear to him that it would be wise to destroy the northern end of the bridge,
because otherwise the Scythians might rush it. Indeed, even as they honeyed the
Greeks set to work to demolish the end that linked them to the Scythians as
quickly as possible. In accordance with the suggestions of Histiaeus the Scythians
rode off in search of the Persians, and so left the Greeks safe in either
event. If Darius escaped, they could be on his side; if he were destroyed,
there was nothing of which the Scythians could complain.

Histiaeus did not put it quite in that fashion to Darius.
He had at least kept the shipping and most of the bridge. He represented
himself as the loyal friend of Persia, and Darius was not disposed to be too
critical. The Ionian ships came over. With a sense of immense relief the
remnant of the wasted Persians were presently looking back at the steely flood
of the Danube streaming wide between themselves and their pursuers. . . .

The pleasure and interest had gone out of the European
expedition for Darius. He returned to Susa, leaving an army in Thrace, under a
trusted general Megabazus. This Megabazus set himself to the subjugation of
Thrace, and among other states which submitted reluctantly to Darius was a
kingdom, which thus comes into our history for the first time, the kingdom of
Macedonia, a country inhabited by a people so closely allied to the Greeks that
one of its princes had already been allowed to compete and take a prize in the
Olympian games.

Darius was disposed to reward Histiaeus by allowing him to
build a city for himself in Thrace, but Megabazus had a different opinion of
the trustworthiness of Histiaeus, and prevailed upon the king to take him to
Susa, and, under the title of councillor, to keep him a prisoner there.
Histiaeus was at first flattered by this court position, and then realized its
true meaning. The Persian court bored him, and he grew homesick for Miletus. He
set himself to make mischief, and was able to stir up a revolt against the
Persians among the Ionian Greeks on the mainland. The twistings and turnings of
the story, which included the burning of Sardis by the Ionians and the defeat
of a Greek fleet at the battle of Ladé (495 B.C.), are too complicated to
follow here. It is a dark and intricate story of treacheries, cruelties, and
hate, in which the death of the wily Histiaeus shines almost cheerfully. The
Persian governor of Sardis, through which town he was being taken on his way
back to Susa as a prisoner, having much the same opinion of him as Megabazus
had, and knowing his ability to humbug Darius, killed him there and then, and
sent on the head only to his master.

Cyprus and the Greek islands were dragged into this contest
that Histiaeus had stirred up, and at last Athens. Darius realized the error he
had made in turning to the right and not to the left when he had crossed the
Bosphorus, and he now set himself to the conquest of all Greece. He began with
the islands. Tyre and Sidon were subject to Persia, and ships of the Phoenician
and of the Ionian Greeks provided the Persians with a fleet by means of which one
Greek island after another was subjugated.
