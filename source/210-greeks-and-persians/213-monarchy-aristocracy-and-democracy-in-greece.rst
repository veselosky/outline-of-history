21.3 Monarchy, Aristocracy and Democracy in Greece
========================================================================
The government of these city-states varied very widely in
its nature. As they settled down after their conquests the Greeks retained for
a time the rule of their kings, but these kingdoms drifted back more and more
to the rule of the aristocratic class. In Sparta (Lacedemon) kings were still
distinguished in the sixth century B.C. The Lacedemonians had a curious system
of a double kingship; two kings, drawn from different royal families, ruled
together. But most of the Greek city-states had become aristocratic republics long
before the sixth century. There is, however, a tendency towards slackness and
inefficiency in most families that rule by hereditary right; sooner or later
they decline; and as the Greeks got out upon the seas and set up colonies and
commerce extended, new rich families arose to jostle the old and bring new
personalities into power. These *nouveaux
riches* became members of an expanded ruling class, a mode of government
known as oligarchy–in opposition to aristocracy–though, strictly, the term
oligarchy (= government by the few) should of course include hereditary
aristocracy as a special case.

In many cities persons of exceptional energy, taking
advantage of some social conflict or class grievance, secured a more or less
irregular power in the state. This combination of personality and opportunity
has occurred in the United States of America, for example, where men exercising
various kinds of informal power are called *bosses.*
In Greece they were called tyrants. But the tyrant was rather more than a boss;
he was recognized as a monarch, and claimed the authority of a monarch. The
modern boss, on the other hand, shelters behind legal forms which he has «got
hold of' and uses for his own ends. Tyrants were distinguished from kings, who
claimed some sort of right, some family priority, for example, to rule. They
were supported, perhaps, by the poorer class with a grievance; Peisistratus,
for example, who was tyrant of Athens, with two intervals of exile, between 560
and 527 B.C., was supported by the poverty-struck Athenian hill men. Sometimes
as in Greek Sicily, the tyrant stood for the rich against the poor. When, later
on, the Persians began to subjugate the Greek cities of Asia Minor, they set up
pro-Persian tyrants.

Aristotle, the great philosophical teacher, who was born
under the hereditary Macedonian monarchy, and who was for some years tutor to
the king's son, distinguishes in his Politics between kings who ruled by an
admitted and inherent right, such as the King of Macedonia, whom he served, and
tyrants who ruled without the consent of the governed. As a matter of fact, it
is hard to conceive of a tyrant ruling without the consent of many, and the
active participation of a substantial number of his subjects; and the devotion
and unselfishness of your «true kings» has been known to rouse resentment and
questioning. Aristotle was also able to say that while the king ruled for the
good of the state, the tyrant ruled for his own good. Upon this point, as in
his ability to regard slavery as a natural thing and to consider women unfit
for freedom and political rights, Aristotle was in harmony with the trend of
events about him.

A third form of government that prevailed increasingly in
Greece in the sixth, fifth, and fourth centuries B.C., was known as 
*democracy*. As the modern world nowadays
is constantly talking of democracy, and as the modern idea of democracy is
something widely different from the democracy of the Greek city-states, it will
be well to be very explicit upon the meaning of democracy in Greece. Democracy
then was government by the commonalty, the Demos; it was government by the
whole body of the citizens, by the many as distinguished from the few. But let
the modern reader mark that word «citizen». The slave was excluded, the
freedman was excluded, the stranger; even the Greek born in the city, whose
father had come eight or ten miles from the city beyond the headland, was
excluded. The earlier democracies (but not all) demanded a property
qualification from the citizen, and property in those days was land; this was
subsequently relaxed, but the modern reader will grasp that here was something
very different from modern democracy. At the end of the fifth century B.C. this
property qualification had been abolished in Athens, for example; but Pericles,
a great Athenian statesman of whom we shall have more to tell later, had
established a law (451 B.C.) restricting citizenship to those who could
establish Athenian descent on both sides. Thus, in the Greek democracies quite
as much as in the oligarchies, the citizens formed a
*close corporation*, ruling sometimes, as in the case of Athens in
its great days, a big population of serfs, slaves, and «outlanders». A modern
politician used to the idea, the entirely now, and different idea, that
democracy in its perfected form means that every adult man and woman shall have
a voice in the government, would, if suddenly spirited back to the extremist
Greek democracy, regard it as a kind of oligarchy. The only real difference
between a Greek «oligarchy» and a Greek democracy was that in the former the
poorer and less important citizens had no voice in the government, and in the
latter every citizen had. Aristotle, in his Politics, betrays very clearly the
practical outcome of this difference. Taxation set lightly on the rich in the
oligarchies; the democracies, on the other hand, taxed the rich, and generally
paid the impecunious citizen a maintenance allowance and special fees. In
Athens fees were paid to citizens even for attending the general assembly. But
the generality of people outside the happy order of citizens worked and did
what they were told, and if one desired the protection of the law, one sought a
citizen to plead for one. For only the citizen had any standing in the law
courts. The modern idea, that any one in the state should be a citizen, would
have shocked the privileged democrats of Athens profoundly.

One obvious result of this monopolization of the state by
the class of citizens was that, the patriotism of these privileged people took
an intense and narrow form. They would form alliances, but never coalesce with
other city-states. That would have obliterated every advantage by which they
lived. The narrow geographical limits, of these Greek states added to the
intensity of their feeling. A man's love for his country was reinforced by his
love for his native town, his religion, and his home; for these were all one.
Of course the slaves did not share in these feelings, and in the oligarchic
states very often the excluded class got over its dislike of foreigners in its
greater dislike of the class at home which oppressed it. But in the main,
patriotism in the Greek was a personal passion of an inspiring and dangerous
intensity. Like rejected love, it was apt to turn into something very like
hatred. The Greek exile resembled the French or Russian
*émigré* in being ready to treat his beloved country pretty roughly
in order to save her from the devils in human form who had taken possession of
her and turned him out.

In the fifth century B.C. Athens formed a system of
relationships with a number of other Greek city-states which is often spoken of
by historians as the Athenian Empire. But all the other city-states retained
their own governments. One «new fact» added by the Athenian Empire was the
complete and effective suppression of piracy; another was the institution of a
sort of international law. The law indeed was Athenian law; but actions could
now be brought and justice administered between citizens of the different
states of the League, which of course bad not been possible before. The
Athenian Empire had really developed out of a league of mutual defence, against
Persia; its seat had originally been in the island of Delos, and the allies had
contributed to a common treasure at Delos; the treasure of Delos was carried
off to Athens because it was exposed to a possible Persian raid. Then one city
after another offered a monetary contribution instead of military service, with
the result that in the end Athens was doing almost all the work and receiving
almost all the money. She was supported by one or two of the larger islands.
The «League» in this, way became gradually an «Empire», but the citizens of the
allied states remained, except where there were special treaties of
intermarriage and the like, practically foreigners to one another. And it was
chiefly the poorer citizens of Athens who sustained this empire by their most
vigorous and incessant personal service. Every citizen was liable to military
service at home or abroad between the ages of eighteen and sixty, sometimes on
purely Athenian affairs and sometimes in defence of the cities of the Empire
whose citizens had bought themselves off. There was probably no single man over
twenty-five in the Athenian Assembly who had not served in several campaigns in
different parts of the Mediterranean or Black Sea, and who did not expect to
serve again. Modern imperialism is denounced by its opponents as the
exploitation of the world by the rich; Athenian imperialism was the
exploitation of the world by the poorer citizens of Athens.

Another difference from modem conditions, due to the small
size of, the Greek city-states, was that in a democracy every citizen had the
right to attend and speak and vote in the popular assembly. For most cities
this meant a gathering of only a few hundred people; the greatest had no more
than some thousands of citizens. Nothing of this sort is possible in a modern
«democracy» with, perhaps, several million voters. The modern «citizen's» voice
in public affairs is limited to the right to vote for one or other of the party
candidates put before him. He, or she, is then supposed to have «assented» to
the resultant government. Aristotle, who would have enjoyed the electoral
methods of our modern democracies keenly, points out very subtly how the
outlying farmer class of citizens in a democracy can be virtually
disenfranchised by calling the popular assembly too frequently for their
regular attendance. In the later Greek democracies (fifth century) the
appointment of public officials, except in the case of officers requiring very
special knowledge, was by casting lots. This was supposed to protect the
general corporation of privileged citizens from the continued predominance of
rich, influential, and conspicuously able men.

Some democracies (Athens and Miletus, e.g.) had an
institution called the ostracism,\ [#fn2]_ 
by which in times of crisis and conflict
the decision was made whether some citizen should go into exile for ten years.
This may strike a modem reader as an envious institution, but that was not its
essential quality. It was, says Gilbert Murray, a way of arriving at a decision
in a case when political feeling was so divided as to threaten a deadlock.
There were in the Greek democracies parties and party leaders, but no regular
government in office and no regular opposition. There was no way, therefore, of
carrying out a policy, although it might be the popular policy, if a strong
leader or a strong group stood out against it. But by the ostracism, the least
popular or the least trusted of the chief leaders in the divided community was
made to retire for a period without loss of honour or property. Professor
Murray suggests that a Greek democracy, if it had found itself in such a
position of deadlock as the British Empire did upon the question of Home Rule
for Ireland in 1914, would have probably first ostracized Sir Edward Carson,
and then proceeded too carry out the provisions of the Home Rule Bill.

This institution of the ostracism has immortalized one
obscure and rather illiterate member of the democracy of Athens. A certain
Aristides had gained a great reputation in the law court for his righteous
dealing. He fell into a dispute with Themistocles upon a question of naval
policy; Aristides was for the army, Themistocles was a «strong navy» man, and a
deadlock was threatened. There was resort to an ostracism to decide between
them. Plutarch relates that as Aristides walked through the streets while the
voting was in progress, he was accosted by a strange citizen from the
agricultural environs unaccustomed to the art of writing, and requested to
write his own name on the proffered potsherd.

«But why?» he asked. «Has Aristides ever injured you?»
«No», said the citizen. «No. Never have I set eyes on him. But, oh! I am so 
*bored* by hearing him called Aristides
the Just».

Whereupon, says Plutarch, without further parley Aristides
wrote as the man desired. . . .

When one understands the true meaning of these Greek
constitutions, and in particular the limitation of all power, whether in the
democracies or the oligarchies, to a locally privileged class, one realizes how
impossible was any effective union of the hundreds of Greek cities scattered
about the Mediterranean region, or even of any effective co-operation between
them for a common end. Each city was in the hands of a few or a few hundred
men, to whom its separateness meant everything that was worth having in life.
Only conquest from the outside could unite the Greeks, and until Greece was
conquered they had no political unity. When at last they were conquered, they
were conquered so completely that their unity ceased to be of any importance,
even to themselves; it was a unity of subjugation.

Yet there was always a certain tradition of unity between
all the Greeks, based on a common language and script, on the, common
possession of the heroic epics, and on the continuous intercourse that the
maritime position of the states made possible. And in addition, there were
certain religious bonds of a unifying kind. Certain shrines, the shrines of the
god Apollo in the island of Delos and at Delphi, for example, were sustained
not by single states, but by leagues of states or Amphictyonies, (= League of
neighbours), which in such instances as the Delphic amphictyony became very
wide-reaching unions. The league protected the shrine and the safety of
pilgrims, kept up the roads leading thereunto, secured peace at the time of
special festivals, upheld certain rules to mitigate the usages of war among its
members, and–the Delian league especially–suppressed piracy. A still more
important link of Hellenic union was the Olympian games that were held every
four years at Olympia. Foot races, boxing, wrestling, javelin throwing, quoit
throwing, jumping, and chariot and horse racing were the chief sports, and a
record of victors and distinguished visitors was kept. From the year 776 B.C.
onward\ [#fn3]_  these games were
held regularly for over a thousand years, and they
did much to maintain that sense of a common Greek life (pan-Hellenic)
transcending the narrow politics of the city-states.

Such links of sentiment and association were of little
avail against the intense «separatism» of the Greek political institutions.
From the History of Herodotus the student will be able to gather a sense of the
intensity and persistence of the feuds that kept the Greek world in a state of
chronic warfare. In the old days (say, to the sixth century B.C.) fairly large
families prevailed in Greece, and something of the old Aryan great household
system (see Chap. XX), with its strong clan feeling and its capacity for
maintaining an enduring feud, still remained. The history of Athens circles for
many years about the feud of two great families, the Alcmaeonidae and the
Peisistratidae; the latter equally an aristocratic family, but founding its
power on the support of the poorer class of the populace and the exploitation
of their grievances. Later on, in the sixth and fifth centuries, a limitation
of births and a shrinkage of families to two or three members–a process
Aristotle notes without perceiving its cause–led to the disappearance of the
old aristocratic clans, and the later wars were due rather to trade disputes
and grievances caused and stirred up by individual adventurers than to family
vendettas.

It is easy to understand, in view of this intense
separatism of the Greeks, how readily the Ionians of Asia and of the islands
fell first under the domination of the kingdom of Lydia, and then under that of
the Persians when Cyrus overthrew Croesus, the king of Lydia. They rebelled
only to be reconquered. Then came the turn of European Greece. It is a matter
of astonishment the Greeks themselves were astonished, to find that Greece
itself did not fall under the dominion of the Persians, these barbaric Aryan
masters of the ancient, civilization of Western Asia. But before we tell of
this struggle we must give some attention to these Asiatics against whom they
were pitted; and particularly to these Medes, and Persians who, by 538 B.C.,
were already in possession of the ancient civilizations of Assyria, Babylonia
and about to subjugate Egypt.
