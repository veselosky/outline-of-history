21.2 Distinctive Features of Hellenic Civilization
========================================================================
Now this Greek civilization that we find growing up in
South Italy and Greece and Asia Minor in the seventh century B.C., is a
civilization differing in many important respects from the two great civilized
systems whose growths we have already traced, that of the Nile and that of the
Two Rivers of Mesopotamia. These civilizations grew through long ages where
they are found; they grew slowly about a temple life out of a primitive
agriculture; priest-kings and god-kings consolidated such early city-states
into empires. But the barbaric Greek herdsmen raiders came southward into a
world whose civilization was already an old story. Shipping and agriculture,
walled cities and writing were already there. The Greeks did not grow a
civilization of their own; they wrecked one and put another together upon and
out of the ruins.

To this we must ascribe the fact that there is no
temple-state stage, no stage of priest-kings, in the Greek record. The Greeks
got at once to the city organization that in the east had grown round the
temple. They took over the association of temple and city; the idea was
ready-made for them. What impressed them most about the city was probably its
wall. It is doubtful if they took to city life and citizenship straight away.
At first they lived in open villages outside the ruins of the cities they had
destroyed, but there stood the model for them, a continual suggestion. They
thought first of a city as a safe place in a time of strife, and of the temple
uncritically as a proper feature of the city. They came into this inheritance
of a previous civilization with the ideas and traditions of the woodlands still
strong in their minds. The heroic social system of the *Iliad* took possession of the land, and adapted itself to the new
conditions. As history goes on the Greeks became more religious and
superstitious as the faiths of the conquered welled up from below.

We have already said that the social structure of the
primitive Aryans was a two-class system of nobles and commoners, the classes
not very sharply marked off from each other, and led in warfare by a king who
was simply the head of one of the noble families, 
*primus* *inter pares,* a
leader among his equals. With the conquest of the aboriginal population and
with the building of towns there was added to this simple social arrangement of
two classes a lower stratum of farm-workers and skilled and unskilled workers,
who were for the most part slaves. But all the Greek communities wore not of
this «conquest» type. Some were «refugee» cities representing smashed
communities, and in these the aboriginal substratum would be missing.

In many of the former cases the survivors of the earlier
population formed a subject class, slaves of the state as a whole, as, for
instance, the Helots in Sparta. The nobles and commoners became landlords and
gentlemen farmers; it was they who directed the shipbuilding and engaged in
trade. But some of the poorer free citizens followed mechanic arts, and, as we
have already noted, would even pull an oar in a galley for pay. Such priests as
there were in this Greek world were either the guardians of shrines and temples
or sacrificial functionaries; Aristotle, in his
*Politics*, makes them a mere subdivision of his official class. The
citizen served as warrior in youth, ruler in his maturity, priest in his old
age. The priestly *class*, in
comparison with the equivalent class in Egypt and Babylonia, was small and
insignificant. The gods of the Greeks proper, the gods of the heroic Greeks,
were, as we have already noted, glorified human beings, and they were treated
without very much fear or awe; but beneath these gods of the conquering freemen
lurked other gods of the subjugated peoples, who found their furtive followers
among slaves and women. The original Aryan gods were not expected to work
miracles or control men's lives. But Greece, like most of the Eastern world in
the thousand years B.C., was much addicted to consulting oracles or soothsayers.
Delphi was particularly famous for its oracle. «When the Oldest Men in the
tribe could not tell you the right thing to do, «says Gilbert Murray», you went
to the blessed dead. All oracles were at the tombs of Heroes. They told you
what was 'Themis,' what was the right thing to do, or, as religious people
would put it now, what was the Will of the God».

The priests and priestesses of these temples were not
united into one class, nor did they exercise any power as a class. It was the
nobles and free commoners, two classes which, in some cases, merged into one
common body of citizens, who constituted the Greek state. In many cases,
especially in great city-states, the population of slaves and unenfranchised
strangers greatly outnumbered the citizens. But for them the state existed only
by courtesy; it existed legally for the select body of citizens alone. It might
or might not tolerate the outsider and the slave, but they had no legal voice
in their treatment –any more than if it had been a despotism.

This is a social structure differing widely from that of
the Eastern monarchies. The exclusive importance of the Greek citizen reminds
one a little of the exclusive importance of the children of Israel in the later
Jewish state, but there is no equivalent on the Greek side to the prophets and
priests, nor to the idea of an overruling Jehovah.

Another contrast between the Greek states and any of the
human communities to which we have hitherto given attention is their continuous
and incurable division.

The civilizations of Egypt, Sumeria, China, and no doubt
North India, all began in a number of independent city states, each one a city
with a, few miles of dependent agricultural villages and cultivation around it,
but out of this phase they passed by a process of coalescence into kingdoms and
empires. But to the very end of their independent history the Greeks did not
coalesce. Commonly this is ascribed to the geographical conditions under which
they lived. Greece is a country cut up into a multitude of valleys by mountain
masses and arms of the sea that render intercommunication difficult; so
difficult that few cities were able to hold many of the others in subjection
for any length of time. Moreover, many Greek cities were on islands and
scattered along remote coasts. To the end the largest city-states of Greece
remained smaller than many English counties; and some had an area of only a few
square miles. Athens, one of the largest of the Greek cities, at the climax of
its power had a population of perhaps a third of a million. Few other Greek
cities exceeded 50,000. Of this, half or more were slaves and strangers, and
two-thirds of the free body women and children.
