21.5 The Rise of the Persians in the East
========================================================================
Now while one series of Aryan-speaking invaders had
developed along the lines we have described in Greece, Magna Graecia, and
around the shores of the Black Sea, another series of Aryan-speaking peoples,
whose originally Nordic blood was perhaps already mixed with a Mongolian
element, were settling and spreading to the north and east of the Assyrian and
Babylonian empires. We have already spoken of the arc-like dispersion of the
Nordic Aryan peoples to the north of the Black and Caspian Seas; it was
probably by this route that the Aryan speaking races gradually came down into
what is now the Persian country, and spread, on the one hand, eastward to India
(? 2,000 to 1,000 B.C.), and on the other, increased and multiplied in the
Persian uplands until they were strong enough to assail first Assyria (650
B.C.) and then Babylon (538 B.C.).

There is much that is not yet clear about the changes of
climate that have been going on in Europe and Asia during the last 10,000
years. The ice of the last glacial age receded gradually, and gave way to a
long period of steppe or prairie-like conditions over the great plain of
Europe. About 12,000 or 10,000 years ago, as it is reckoned now, this state of
affairs was giving place to forest conditions. We have already noted how, as a
consequence of these changes, the Solutrian horse hunters gave place to
Magdalenian fishers and forest deer hunters; and these, again, to the Neolithic
herdsmen and agriculturists. For some thousands of years the European climate
seems to have been warmer than it is today. A great sea spread from the coast
of the Balkan Peninsula far into Central Asia and extended northward into
Central Russia, and the shrinkage of that sea and the consequent hardening of
the climate of South Russia and Central Asia was going on contemporaneously
with the development of the first civilizations in the river valleys. Many
facts seem to point to a more genial climate in Europe and Western Asia, and
still more strongly to a greater luxuriance of plant and vegetable life, 4,000
to 3,000 years ago, than we find today. There were forests then in South Russia
and in the country which is now Western Turkestan, where now steppes and
deserts prevail. On the other hand, between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago, the
Aral-Caspian region was probably drier and those seas smaller than they are at
the present time.

We may note in this connection that Thothmes III (say, the
fifteenth century B.C.), in his expedition beyond the Euphrates, hunted a herd
of 120 elephants in that region. Again, an Aegean dagger from Mycenae, dating
about 2,000 B.C., shows a lion-hunt in progress. The hunters carry big shields
and spears, and stand in rows one behind the other. The first man spears the
lion, and when the wounded beast leaps at him, drops flat under the protection
of his big shield, leaving the next man to repeat his stroke, and so on, until
the lion is speared to death. This method of hunting is practised by the Masai
today, and could only have been worked out by a people in a land where lions
were abundant. But abundant lions imply abundant game, and that again means
abundant vegetation. About 2,000 B.C. the hardening of the climate in the
central parts of the Old World, to which we have already referred, which put an
end to elephants and lions in Asia Minor and
Greece,\ [#fn4]_  was turning the faces
of the nomadic Aryan peoples southward towards the fields and forests of the
more settled and civilized nations.

These Aryan peoples come down from the East Caspian regions
into history about the time that Mycenae and Troy and Cnossos are falling to
the Greeks. It is difficult to disentangle the different tribes and races that
appear under a multitude of names in the records and inscriptions that record
their first appearance, but, fortunately, these distinctions are not needed in
an elementary outline such as this present history. A people called the
Cimmerians appear in the districts of Lake Urumiya and Van, and shortly after
Aryans have spread from Armenia to Elam. In the ninth century B.C., a people
called the Medes, very closely related to the Persians to the east of them,
appear in the Assyrian inscriptions. Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II, names
already familiar in this story, profess to have made them pay tribute. They are
spoken of in the inscriptions as the «dangerous Medes». They are as yet a
tribal people, not united under one king.

About the ninth century B.C. Elam and the Elamites, whose
capital was Susa, a people which possessed a tradition and civilization at
least as old as the Sumerian, suddenly vanish from history. We do not know what
happened. They seem to have been overrun and the population absorbed by the
conquerors. Susa is in the hands of the Persians.

A fourth people, related to these Aryan tribes, who appear
at this time in the narrative of Herodotus, are the «Scythians». For a while
the monarchs of Assyria play off these various kindred peoples, the Cimmerians,
the Medes, the Persians, and the Scythians, against each other. Assyrian
princesses (a daughter of Esarhaddon, e.g.) are married to Scythian chiefs.

Nebuchadnezzar the Great, on the other hand, marries a
daughter of Cyaxares, who has become king of all the Medes. The Aryan Scythians
are for the Semitic Assyrians; the Aryan Medes for the Semitic Babylonians. It
was this Cyaxares who took Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, in 606 B.C., and so
released Babylon from the Assyrian yoke to establish, under Chaldean rule, the
Second Babylonian Empire. The Scythian allies of Assyria drop out of the story
after this. They go on living their own life away to the north without much
interference with the peoples to the south. A glance at the map of this period
shows how, for two-thirds of a century, the Second. Babylonian Empire lay like
a lamb within the embrace of the Median lion.

Into the internal struggles of the Medes and Persians, that
ended at last in the accession of Cyrus «the Persian» to the throne of Cyaxares
in 550 B.C., we will not enter. In that year Cyrus was ruling over an empire
that reached from the boundaries of Lydia to Persia and perhaps to India.
Nabonidus, the last of the Babylonian rulers, was, as we have already told,
digging up old records and building temples in Babylonia.

.. [#fn4]  It is, at least, doubtful whether any change of climate expelled
    either lion or elephant from southeast Europe and Asia Minor; the cause of their
    gradual disappearance was — I think — nothing but Man, increasingly well armed for
    the chase. Lions lingered in the Balkan peninsula till about the fourth century
    B.C., if not later. Elephants had perhaps disappeared from western Asia by the
    eighth century B.C. The lion (much bigger than the existing form) stayed on in
    southern Germany till the Neolithic period. The panther inhabited Greece,
    southern Italy, and southern Spain likewise till the beginning of the historical
    period (say 3,000 B.C.). —H. H. J.
