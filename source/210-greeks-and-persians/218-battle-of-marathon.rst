21.8 The Battle of Marathon
========================================================================
The first attack upon Greece proper was made in 490 B.C. It
was a sea attack upon Athens, with a force long and carefully prepared for the
task, the fleet being provided with specially built transports for the
conveyance of horses. This expedition made a landing near Marathon in Attica.
The Persians were guided into Marathon by a renegade Greek, Hippias, the son of
Peisistratus, who had been tyrant of Athens. If Athens fell, then Hippias was
to be its tyrant, under the protection of the Persians.

Meanwhile, so urgent was the sense of a crisis in the
affairs of Hellas, that a man, a herald and runner, went from Athens to Sparta,
forgetful of all feuds, to say: «Lacedemonians, the Athenians make request of
you to come to their help, and not to allow a city most anciently established
among the Hellenes to fall into slavery by the means of Barbarians; for even
now Eretria has been enslaved and Hellas has become the weaker by a city of
renown. « This man, Pheidippides, did the distance from Athens to Sparta,
nearly a hundred miles as the crow flies, and much more if we allow for the
contours and the windings of the way, in something under eight and forty hours.

But before the Spartans could arrive on the scene the
battle was joined The Athenians charged the enemy. They fought –»in a memorable
fashion: for they were the first of all the Hellenes about whom we know who
went to attack the enemy at a run, and they were the first also who endured to
face the Median garments and the men who wore them, whereas up to this time the
very name of the Medes was to the Hellenes a terror to hear».

The Persian wings gave before this impetuous attack, but
the centre held. The Athenians, however, were cool as well as vigorous; they
let the wings run and closed in on the flanks of the centre, whereupon the main
body of the Persians fled to their ships. Seven vessels fell into the hands of
the Athenians; the rest got away, and, after a futile attempt to sail round to
Athens and seize the city before the army returned thither, the fleet made a
retreat to Asia. Let Herodotus close the story with a paragraph that still
further enlightens us upon the tremendous prestige of the Medes at this time:

«Of the Lacedemonians there came to Athens two thousand
after the full moon, making great haste to be in time, so that they arrived in
Attica on the third day after leaving Sparta: and though they had come too late
for the battle, yet they desired to behold the Medes; and accordingly they went
on to Marathon and looked at the bodies of the slain: then afterwards they
departed home, commending the Athenians and the work which they had done».
