21.9 Thermopylae and Salamis
========================================================================
So Greece, unified for a while by fear, gained her first
victory over Persia. The news came to Darius simultaneously with the news of a
rebellion in Egypt, and he died while still undecided in which direction to
turn. His son and successor, Xerxes, turned first to Egypt and set up a Persian
satrap there; then for four years he prepared a second attack upon Greece. Says
Herodotus, who was, one must remember, a patriotic Greek, approaching new to
the climax of his History:

«For what nation did Xerxes not lead out of Asia against
Hellas? and what water was not exhausted, being drunk by his host, except only
the great rivers? For some supplied ships, and others were appointed to serve
in the land army; to some it was appointed to furnish cavalry, and to others
vessels to carry horses, while they served in the expedition themselves also;
others were ordered to furnish ships of war for the bridges, and others again
ships with provisions».

Xerxes passed into Europe, not as Darius did at the half-mile
crossing of the Bosphorus, but at the Hellespont (== the Dardanelles). In his
account of the assembling of the great army, and its march from Sardis to the
Hellespont, the poet in Herodotus takes possession of the historian. The great
host passes in splendour by Troy, and Xerxes, who although a Persian and a
Barbarian, seems to have had the advantages of a classical education, turns
aside, says our historian, to visit the citadel of Priam. The Hellespont was
bridged at Abydos, and upon a hill was set a marble throne from which Xerxes
surveyed the whole array of his forces.

    «And seeing all the Hellespont covered over
    with the ships and all the shores and the plains of Abydos full of men, then
    Xerxes pronounced himself a happy man, and after that he fell to weeping.
    Artabanus, his uncle, therefore perceiving him–the same who at first boldly
    declared his opinion advising Xerxes not to march against Hellas–this man, I
    say, having observed Xerxes wept, asked as follows: '0 king, how far different
    from one another are the things which thou hast done now and a short while
    before now I for having pronounced thyself a happy man, thou art now shedding
    tears.' He said: 'Yea, for after I had reckoned up, it came into my mind to
    feel pity at the thought how brief was the whole life of man, seeing that of
    these multitudes not one will be alive when a hundred years have gone by'».

This may not be exact history, but it is great poetry. It
is as splendid as anything in *The
Dynasts.*

The Persian fleet, coasting from headland to headland,
accompanied this land multitude during its march southward; but a violent storm
did the fleet great damage and 400 ships were lost, including much corn
transport. At first the united Hellenes marched out to meet the invaders at the
Vale of Tempe near Mount Olympus, but afterwards retreated through Thessaly,
and chose at last to await the advancing Persians at a place called
Thermopylae, where at that time – 2,300 years have altered these things
greatly – there was a great cliff on the landward side and the sea to the east,
with a track scarcely wide enough for a chariot between. The great advantage to
the Greeks of this position at Thermopylae was that it prevented the use of
either cavalry or chariots, and narrowed the battle front so as to minimize
their numerical inequality. And there the Persians joined battle with them one
summer day in the year 480 B.C.

For three days the Greeks held this great army, and did
them much damage with small loss to themselves, and then on the third day a detachment
of Persians appeared upon the rear of the Greeks, having learnt of a way over
the mountains from a peasant. There were hasty discussions among the Greeks;
some were for withdrawing, some for holding out. The leader of the whole force,
Leonidas, was for staying; and with him he would keep, he said, 300 Spartans.
The rest of the Greek army could, meanwhile, make good its retreat to the next
defensible pass. The Thespian contingent of 700, however, refused to fall back.
They preferred to stay and die with the Spartans. Also a contingent of 400
Thebans remained. As Thebes afterwards joined the Persians, there is a story
that these Thebans were detained by force against their will, which seems on
military as well as historical grounds improbable. These 1,400 stayed, and
were, after a conflict of heroic quality, slain to a man. Two Spartans happened
to be away, sick with ophthalmia. When they heard the news, one was too ill to
move; the other made his helot guide him to the battle, and there struck blindly
until he was killed. The other, Aristodemus, was taken away with the retreating
troops, and returned to Sparta, where he was not actually punished for his
conduct, but was known as Tresas, «the man who retreated». It was enough to
distinguish him from all other Spartans, and he got himself killed at the
Battle of Plataea a year later, performing prodigies of reckless courage. . . .
For a whole day this little band had held the pass, assailed in front and rear
by the whole force of the Persians. They had covered the retreat of the main
Greek army, they had inflicted great losses on the invaders, and they had
raised the prestige of the Greek warrior over that of the Mede higher even than
the victory of Marathon had done.

The Persian cavalry and transport filtered slowly through
the narrow passage of Thermopylae and marched on towards Athens, while a series
of naval encounters went on at sea. The Hellenic fleet retreated before the
advance of the Persian shipping, which suffered seriously through its comparative
ignorance of the intricate coasts and of the tricks of the local weather.
Weight of numbers carried the Persian army forward to Athens; now that
Thermopylae was lost, there was no line of defence nearer than the Isthmus of
Corinth, and this meant the abandonment of all the intervening territory,
including Athens. The population had either to fly or submit to the Persians.
Thebes with all Boeotia submitted, and was pressed into the Persian army,
except one town, Plataea, whose inhabitants fled to Athens. The turn of Athens
came next, and great efforts were made to persuade her to make terms; but,
instead, the whole population determined to abandon everything and take to the
shipping. The women and non-combatants were carried to Salamis and various
adjacent islands. Only a few people too old to move and a few dissentients
remained in the town, which was occupied by the Persians and burnt. The sacred
objects, statues, etc., which were burnt at this time, were afterwards buried
in the Acropolis by the returning Athenians, and have been dug up in our own
day with the marks of burning visible upon them. Xerxes sent off a mounted
messenger to Susa with the news, and he invited the sons of Peisistratus, whom
he had brought back with him, to enter upon their inheritance and sacrifice
after the Athenian manner upon the Acropolis.

Meanwhile, the Hellenic confederate fleet had come round to
Salamis, and in the council of war there were bitter differences of opinion.
Corinth and the states behind the Isthmus wanted the fleet to fall back to that
position, abandoning the cities of Megara and Aegina. Themistocles insisted
with all his force on fighting in the narrows of Salamis. The majority was
steadily in favour of retreat, when there suddenly arrived the news that
retreat was cut off. The Persians had sailed round Salamis and held the sea on
the other side. This news was brought by that Aristides the Just, of whose
ostracism we have already told; his sanity and eloquence did much to help
Themistocles to hearten the hesitating commanders. These two men had formerly
been bitter antagonists; but, with a generosity rare in those days, they forgot
their differences before the common danger. At dawn the Greek ships pulled out
to battle.

The fleet before them was a fleet more composite and less
united than their own. But it was about three times as great. On one wing were
the Phoenicians, on the other Ionian Greeks from Asia and the Islands. Some of
the latter fought stoutly; others remembered that they, too, were Greeks. The
Greek ships, on the other hand, were mostly manned by freemen fighting for
their homes. Throughout the early hours the battle raged confusedly. Then it
became evident to Xerxes, watching the combat, that his fleet was attempting
flight. The flight became disaster.

Xerxes had taken his seat to watch the battle. He saw his
galleys rammed by the sharp prows of other galleys; his fighting-men shot down;
his ships boarded. Much of the sea fighting in those days was done by ramming;
the big galleys bore down their opponents by superior weight of impact, or
sheared off their oars and so destroyed their manoeuvring power and left them
helpless. Presently, Xerxes saw that some of his broken ships were
surrendering. In the water he could see the heads of Greeks swimming to land;
but «of the Barbarians the greater number perished in the sea, not knowing how
to swim». The clumsy attempt of the hard-pressed first line of the Persian
fleet to put about led to indescribable confusion. Some were rammed by the rear
ships of their own side. This ancient shipping was poor, unseaworthy stuff by
any modern standards. The west wind was blowing and many of the broken ships of
Xerxes were now drifting away out of his sight to be wrecked on the coast
beyond.

Others were being towed towards Salamis by the Greeks.
Others, less injured and still in fighting trim, were making for the beaches
close beneath him that would bring them under the protection of his army.
Scattered over the further sea, beyond the headlands, remote and vague, were
ships in flight and Greek ships in pursuit. Slowly, incident by incident, the
disaster had unfolded under his eyes. We can imagine something of the coming
and going of messengers, the issuing of futile orders, the changes of plan,
throughout the day. In the morning Xerxes had come out provided with tables to
mark the most successful of his commanders for reward. In the gold of the
sunset he beheld the sea power of Persia utterly scattered, sunken and destroyed,
and the Greek fleet over against Salamis unbroken and triumphant, ordering its
ranks, as if still incredulous of victory.

    Figure 287: Map — The World according to Herodotus

The Persian army remained as if in indecision for some days
close to the scene of this sea fight, and then began to retreat to Thessaly,
where it was proposed to winter and resume the campaign. But Xerxes, like
Darius I before him, had conceived a disgust for European campaigns. He was
afraid of the destruction of the bridge of boats. With part of the army he went
on to the Hellespont, leaving the main force in Thessaly under a general,
Mardonius. Of his own retreat the historian relates:

    «Whithersoever they came on the march and
    to whatever nation they seized the crops of that people and used them for
    provisions; and if they found no crops, then they took the grass which was
    growing up from the earth, and stripped off the bark from the trees and plucked
    down the leaves and devoured them; alike of the cultivated trees and of those
    growing wild; and they left nothing behind them: thus they did by reason of
    famine. Then plague too seized upon the army and dysentery, which destroyed
    them by the way, and some of them also who were sick the king left behind,
    laying charge upon the cities where at the time he chanced to be in his march,
    to take care of them and support them; of these he left some in Thessaly, and
    some at Siris in Paionia, and some in Macedonia. . . . When, passing on from
    Thrace they came to the passage, they crossed over the Hellespont in haste to
    Abydos by means of the ships, for they did not find the floating bridges still
    stretched across, but broken up by a storm. While staying there for a time they
    had distributed to them an allowance of food more abundant than they had had by
    the way, and from satisfying their hunger with out restraint and also from the
    changes of water there died many of those in the army who had remained safe
    till then. The rest arrived with Xerxes at Sardis».
