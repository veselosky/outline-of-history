23.4 The Wanderings of Alexander
========================================================================
And now begins a new phase in the story of Alexander. For
the next seven years he wandered with an army chiefly of Macedonians in the
north and east of what was then the known world. At first it was a pursuit of
Darius. Afterwards it became ––? Was it a systematic survey of a world he meant
to consolidate into one great order, or was it a wild-goose chase? His own
soldiers, his own intimates, thought the latter, and at last stayed his career
beyond the Indus. On the map it looks very like a wild-goose chase; it seems to
aim at nothing in particular and to get nowhere.

The pursuit of Darius III soon came to a pitiful end. After
the battle of Arbela his own generals seem to have revolted against his
weakness and incompetence; they made him a prisoner, and took him with them in
spite of his desire to throw himself upon the generosity of his conqueror.
Bessus, the satrap of Bactria, they made their leader. There was at last a hot
and exciting chase of the flying caravan which conveyed the captive king of
kings. At dawn, after an all-night pursuit, it was sighted far ahead. The
flight became a headlong bolt. Baggage, women, everything was abandoned by
Bessus and his captains; and one other impediment also they left behind. By the
side of a pool of water far away from the road a Macedonian trooper presently
found a deserted mule-cart with its mules still in the traces. In this cart lay
Darius, stabbed in a score of places and bleeding to death. He had refused to go
on with Bessus, refused to mount the horse that was brought to him. So his
captains had run him through with their spears and left him. . . . He asked his
captors for water. What else he may have said we do not know. The historians
have seen fit to fabricate a quite impossible last dying speech for him.
Probably he said very little. . . .

When, a little after sunrise, Alexander came up, Darius was
already dead. . . .

To the historian of the world the wanderings of Alexander
have an interest of their own quite apart from the light they throw upon his
character. Just as the campaign of Darius I lifted the curtain behind Greece
and Macedonia, and showed us something of the silent background to the north of
the audible and recorded history of the early civilizations, so now Alexander's
campaigns take us into regions about which there had hitherto been no
trustworthy record made.

We discover they were not desert regions, but full of a
gathering life of their own.

He marched to the shores of the Caspian, thence he travelled
eastward across what is now called Western Turkestan. He founded a city that is
now known as Herat; whence he went northward by Cabul and by what is now
Samarkand, right up into the mountains of Central Turkestan. He returned
southward, and came down into India by the Khyber Pass. He fought a great
battle on the Upper Indus against a very tall and chivalrous king, Porus, in
which the Macedonian infantry encountered an array of elephants and defeated
them. Possibly he would have pushed eastward across the deserts to the Ganges
valley, but his troops refused to go further. Possibly, had they not done so,
then or later he would have gone on until he vanished eastward out of history.
But he was forced to turn about. He built a fleet and descended to the mouth of
the Indus. There he divided his forces. The main army he took along the
desolate coast back to the Persian Gulf, and on the way it suffered dreadfully
and lost many men through thirst. The fleet followed him by sea, and rejoined
him at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. In the course of this six-year tour he
fought battles, received the submission of many strange peoples, and founded
cities. He saw the dead body of Darius in June, 330 B.C.; he returned to Susa
in 324 B.C. He found the empire in disorder: the provincial satraps, raising
armies of their own, Bactria and Media in insurrection, and Olympias making
government impossible in Macedonia. Harpalus, the royal treasurer, had bolted
with all that was portable of the royal treasure, and was making his way,
bribing as he went, towards Greece. Some of the Harpalus money is said to have
reached Demosthenes.

But before we deal with the closing chapter of the story of
Alexander, let us say a word or so about these northern regions into which he
wandered. It is evident that from the Danube region right across South Russia,
right across the country to the north of the Caspian, right across the country
to the east of the Caspian, as far as the mountain masses of the Pamir Plateau
and eastward into the Tarim basin of Eastern Turkestan, there spread then a
series of similar barbaric tribes and peoples all at about the same stage of
culture, and for the most part Aryan in their language and possibly Nordic in
their race. They had few cities, mostly they were nomadic; at times they
settled temporarily to cultivate the land. They were certainly already mingling
in Central Asia with Mongolian tribes, but the Mongolian tribes were not then
prevalent there.

An immense process of drying up and elevation has been going
on in these parts of the world during the last ten thousand years. Ten thousand
years ago there was probably a continuous water barrier between the basin of
the Obi and the Aral-Caspian sea. As this had dried up and the marshy land had
become steppe-like country, Nordic nomads from the west and Mongolian nomads
from the east had met and mixed, and the riding horse had come back into the
western world. It is evident this great stretch of country was becoming a
region of accumulation for these barbaric peoples. They were very loosely
attached to the lands they occupied. They lived in tents and wagons rather than
houses. A brief cycle of plentiful and healthy years, or a cessation of tribal
warfare under some strong ruler, would lead to considerable increases of
population; then two or three hard years would suffice to send the tribes
wandering again in search of food.

From before the dawn of recorded history this region of
human accumulation between the Danube and China had been, as it were,
intermittently *raining* out tribes
southward and westward. It was like a cloud bank behind the settled landscape
that accumulated and then precipitated invaders. We have noted how the Keltic
peoples drizzled westward, how the Italians, the Greeks, and their Epirote,
Macedonian, and Phrygian kindred came south. We have noted, too, the Cimmerian
drive from the east, like a sudden driving shower of barbarians across Asia
Minor, the southward coming of the Scythians and Medes and Persians, and the
Aryan descent into India. About a century before Alexander there had been a
fresh Aryan invasion of Italy by a Keltic people, the Gauls, who had settled in
the valley of the Po. Those various races came down out of their northern
obscurity into the light of history; and meanwhile beyond that light the
reservoir accumulated for fresh discharges. Alexander's march in Central Asia
brings now into our history names that are fresh to us; the Parthians, a race
of mounted bowmen who were destined to play an important role in history a
century or so later, and the Bactrians who lived in the sandy native land of
the camel. Everywhere he seems to have met Aryan-speaking peoples. The
Mongolian barbarians to the north-eastward were still unsuspected, no one
imagined there was yet another great cloud bank of population beyond the
Scythians and their kind, in the north of China, that was presently also to
begin a drift westward and southward, mixing as it came with the Nordic
Scythians and every other people of kindred habits that it encountered. As yet
only China knew of the Huns; there were no Turks in Western Turkestan or
anywhere else then, no Tartars, in the world.

This glimpse of the state of affairs in Turkestan in the
fourth century B.C. is one of the most interesting aspects of the wanderings of
Alexander; another is his raid through the Punjab. From the point of view of
the teller of the human story it is provocative that he did not go on into the
Ganges country, and that consequently we have no independent accounts by Greek
writers of the life in ancient Bengal. But there is a considerable literature
in various Indian languages dealing with Indian history and social life that
still needs to be made accessible to European readers.
