23.2 The Murder of King Philip
========================================================================
It is necessary now to tell something of the domestic life
of King Philip. The lives of both Philip and his son were pervaded by the
personality of a restless and evil woman, Olympias, the mother of Alexander.

She was the daughter of the king of Epirus, a country to
the west of Macedonia, and, like Macedonia, a semi-Greek land. She met Philip,
or was thrown in his way, at some religious gathering in Samothrace. Plutarch
declares the marriage was a love-match, and there seems to be at least this
much in the charges against Philip that, like many energetic and imaginative
men, he was prone to impatient love impulses. He married her when he was
already a king, and Alexander was born to him three years later.

It was not long before Olympias and Philip were bitterly
estranged. She was jealous of him, but there was another and graver source of
trouble in her passion for religious mysteries. We have already noted that
beneath the fine and restrained Nordic religion of the Greeks the land abounded
with religious cults of a darker and more ancient kind, aboriginal cults with
secret initiations, orgiastic celebrations, and often with cruel and obscene
rites. These religions of the shadows, these practices of the women and
peasants and slaves, gave Greece her Orphic, Dionysic, and Demeter cults; they
have lurked in the tradition of Europe down almost to our own times. The
witchcraft of the Middle Ages, with its resort to the blood of babes, scraps of
executed criminals, incantations and magic circles, seems to have been little
else than the lingering vestiges of these solemnities of the dark whites. In
these matters Olympias was an expert and an enthusiast, and Plutarch mentions
that she achieved considerable celebrity by use of tame serpents in these pious
exercises. The snakes invaded her domestic apartments, and history is not clear
whether Philip found in them matter for exasperation or religious awe. These
occupations of his wife must have been a serious inconvenience to Philip, for
the Macedonian people were still in that sturdy stage of social development in
which neither enthusiastic religiosity nor uncontrollable wives are admired.

The evidence of a bitter hostility between mother and
father peeps out in many little things in the histories. She was evidently
jealous is of Philip's conquests; she hated his fame. There are many signs that
Olympias did her best to set her son against his father and attach him wholly
to herself. A story survives (in Plutarch's *Life*)
that «whenever news was brought of Philip's victories, the capture of a city or
the winning of some great battle, he never seemed greatly rejoiced to hear it;
on the contrary he used to say to his play-fellows: 'Father will get everything
in advance, boys; he won't leave any great task for me to share with you.'».
. .

It is not a natural thing for a boy to envy his father in
this fashion without some inspiration. That sentence sounds like an echo.

We have already pointed out how manifest it is that Philip
planned the succession of Alexander, and how eager he was to thrust fame and
power into the boy's hands. He was thinking of the political structure he was
building – but the mother was thinking of the glory and pride of that wonderful
lady, Olympias. She masked her hatred of her husband under the cloak of a
mother's solicitude for her son's future. When in 337 B.C. Philip, after the
fashion of kings in those days, married a second wife who was a native
Macedonian, Cleopatra, «of whom he was passionately enamoured», Olympias made
much trouble.

Plutarch tells of a pitiful scene that occurred at Philip's
marriage to Cleopatra. There was much drinking of wine at the banquet, and
Attalus, the father of the bride, being «intoxicated with liquor», betrayed the
general hostility to Olympias and Epirus by saying he hoped there would be a
child by the marriage to give them a truly Macedonian heir. Whereupon
Alexander, taut for such an insult, cried out, «What then am I ?» and hurled
his cup at Attalus. Philip, enraged, stood up and, says Plutarch, drew his
sword, only to stumble and fall. Alexander, blind with rage and jealousy,
taunted and insulted his father.

«Macedonians», he said. «See there the general who would go
from Europe to Asia! Why! he cannot get from one table to another!»

How that scene lives still, the sprawl, the flushed faces,
the angry voice of the boy! Next day Alexander departed with his mother – and
Philip did nothing to restrain them. Olympias went home to Epirus; Alexander
departed to Illyria. Thence Philip persuaded him to return.

Fresh trouble arose. Alexander had a brother of weak
intellect, Aridaeus, whom the Persian governor of Caria sought as a son-in-law.
«Alexander's friends and his mother now infused notions into him again, though
perfectly groundless, that by so noble a match, and the support consequent upon
it, Philip designed the crown for Aridaeus. Alexander, in the uneasiness these
suspicions gave him, sent one Thessalus, a player, into Caria, to desire the
grandee to pass by Aridaeus, who was of spurious birth, and deficient in point
of understanding, and to take the lawful heir to the crown into his alliance.
Pixodarus was infinitely more pleased with this proposal. But Philip no sooner
had intelligence of it, than he went to Alexander's apartment, taking along
with him Philotas, the son of Parmenio, one of his most intimate friends and
companions, and, in his presence, reproached him with his degeneracy and
meanness of spirit, in thinking of being son-in-law to a man of Caria, one of
the slaves of a barbarian king: At the same time he wrote to the Corinthians,
insisting that they should send Thessalus to him in chains. Harpalus and
Niarchus, Phrygius and Ptolemy, some of the other companions of the prince, he
banished. But Alexander afterwards recalled them, and treated them with great
distinction».

There is something very touching in this story of the
father pleading with the son he manifestly loved, and baffled by the web of
mean suggestion which had been spun about the boy's imagination.

It was at the marriage of his daughter to her uncle, the
king of Epirus and the brother of Olympias, that Philip was stabbed. He was
walking in a procession into the theatre unarmed, in a white robe, and he was
cut down by one of his bodyguard. The murderer had a horse waiting, and would
have got away, but the foot of his horse caught in a wild vine and he was
thrown from the saddle by the stumble and slain by his pursuers....

So at the age of twenty Alexander was at the end of his
anxiety about the succession, and established king in Macedonia.

Olympias then reappeared in Macedonia, a woman proudly
vindicated. It is said that she insisted upon paying the same funeral honours
to the memory of the murderer as to Philip.

In Greece there were great rejoicings over this auspicious
event, and Demosthenes, when he had the news, although it was but seven days
after the death of his own daughter, went into the public assembly at Athens in
gay attire wearing a chaplet.

Whatever Olympias may have done about her husband's
assassin, history does not doubt about her treatment of her supplanter,
Cleopatra. So soon as Alexander was out of the way – and a revolt of the hill men
in the north called at once for his attention – Cleopatra's newly born child was
killed in its mother's arms, and Cleopatra – no doubt after a little taunting – was
then strangled. These excesses of womanly feeling are said to have shocked
Alexander, but they did not prevent him from leaving his mother in a position
of considerable authority in Macedonia. She wrote letters to him upon religious
and political questions, and he showed a dutiful disposition in sending her
always a large share of the plunder he made.
