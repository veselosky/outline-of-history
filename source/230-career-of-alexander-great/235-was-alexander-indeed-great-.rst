23.5 Was Alexander Indeed Great?
========================================================================
Alexander had been in undisputed possession of the Persian Empire
for six years. He was now thirty-one. In those six years he had created very
little. He had retained most of the organization of the Persian provinces,
appointing fresh satraps or retaining the former ones; the roads, the ports,
the organization of the empire was still as Cyrus, his greater predecessor, had
left them; in Egypt he had merely replaced old provincial governors by new
ones; in India he had defeated Porus, and then left him in power much as he
found him, except that Porus was now called a satrap by the Greeks. Alexander
had, it is true, planned out a number of towns, and some of them were to grow
into great towns; seventeen Alexandrias he founded
altogether;\ [#fn1]_  but he had
destroyed Tyre, and with Tyre the security of the sea routes which had hitherto
been the chief westward outlet for Mesopotamia. Historians say that he
Hellenized the east. But Babylonia and Egypt swarmed with Greeks before his
time; he was not the cause, he was a part of the Hellenization. For a time the
whole world, from the Adriatic to the Indus, was under one ruler; so far he had
realized the dreams of Isocrates and Philip his father. But how far was he
making this a permanent and enduring union? How far as yet was it anything more
than a dazzling but transitory flourish of his own magnificent self?

He was making no great roads, setting up no sure sea
communications. It is idle to accuse him of leaving education alone, because
the idea that empires must be cemented by education was still foreign to human
thought. But he was forming no group of statesmen about him; he was thinking of
no successor; he was creating no tradition–nothing more than a personal legend.
The idea that the world would have to go on after Alexander, engaged in any
other employment than the discussion of his magnificence, seems to have been
outside his mental range. He was still young, it is true, but well before
Philip was one and thirty he had been thinking of the education of Alexander.

Was Alexander a statesman at all?

Some students of his career assure us that he was; that now
at Susa he planned a mighty world empire, seeing it not simply as a Macedonian
conquest of the world, but as a melting together of racial traditions. He did
one thing, at any rate, that gives colour to this idea; he held a great
marriage feast, in which he and ninety of his generals and friends were married
to Persian brides. He himself married a daughter of Darius, though already he
possessed an Asiatic wife in Roxana, the daughter of the king of Samarkand.
This wholesale wedding was made a very splendid festival, and at the same time
all of his Macedonian soldiers, to the number of several thousands, who had
married Asiatic brides, were given wedding gifts. This has been called the
Marriage of Europe and Asia; the two continents were to be joined, wrote
Plutarch, «in lawful wedlock and by community of offspring». And next he began
to train recruits from Persia and the north, Parthians, Bactrians, and the
like, in the distinctive disciplines of the phalanx and the cavalry. Was that
also, to assimilate Europe and Asia, or was it to make himself independent of
his Macedonians? They thought the latter, at any rate, and mutinied, and it was
with some difficulty that he brought them to a penitent mood and induced them
to take part in a common feast with the Persians. The historians have made a
long and eloquent speech for him on this occasion, but the gist of it was that
he bade his Macedonians be gone, and gave no sign of how he proposed they
should get home out of Persia. After three days of dismay they submitted to him
and begged his forgiveness.

Here is the matter for a very pretty discussion. Was
Alexander really planning a racial fusion or had he just fallen in love with
the pomp and divinity of an Oriental monarch, and wished to get rid of these
Europeans to whom he was only a king-leader? The writers of his own time, and
those who lived near to his time, lean very much to the latter alternative.
They insist upon his immense vanity. They relate how he began to wear the robes
and tiara of a Persian monarch. «At first only before the barbarians and
privately, but afterwards he came to wear it in public, when he sat for the
dispatch of business. And presently he demanded Oriental prostrations from his
friends.

One thing seems to support the suggestion of great personal
vanity in Alexander. His portrait was painted and sculptured frequently, and
always he is represented as a beautiful youth, with wonderful locks flowing
backward from a broad forehead. Previously most men had worn beards. But
Alexander, enamoured of his own youthful loveliness, would not part with it; he
remained a sham boy at thirty-two; he shaved his face, and so set a fashion in
Greece and Italy that lasted many centuries.

The stories of violence and vanity in his closing years
cluster thick upon his memory. He listened to tittle-tattle about Philotas, the
son of Parmenio, one of his most trusted and faithful generals. Philotas, it
was said, had boasted to some woman he was making love to that Alexander was a
mere boy; that, but for such men as his father and himself, there would have
been no conquest of Persia, and the like. Such assertions had a certain element
of truth in them. The woman was brought to Alexander, who listened to her
treacheries. Presently Philotas was accused of conspiracy, and, upon very
insufficient evidence, tortured and executed. Then Alexander thought of
Parmenio, whose other two sons had died for him in battle. He sent swift
messengers to assassinate the old man before he could hear of his son's death!
Now Parmenio had been one of the most trusted of Philip's generals; it was
Parmenio who had led the Macedonian armies into Asia before the murder of
Philip. There can be little doubt of the substantial truth of this story, nor
about the execution of Callisthenes, the nephew of Aristotle, who refused
Alexander divine honours, and «went about with as much pride as if he had
demolished a tyranny, while the young men followed him as the only freeman
among thousands». Mixed with such incidents we have the very illuminating story
of the drunken quarrel in which he killed Clitus. The monarch and his company
had been drinking hard, and the drink had made the talk loud and free. There
was much flattery of the «young god», much detraction of Philip, at which
Alexander had smiled with
satisfaction.\ [#fn2]_  This drunken self-complacency was
more than the Macedonians could stand; it roused Clitus, his foster-brother, to
a frenzy. Clitus reproached Alexander with his Median costume and praised
Philip, there was a loud quarrel, and, to end it, Clitus was hustled out of the
room by his friends. He was, however, in the obstinate phase of drunkenness,
and he returned by another entrance. He was heard outside quoting Euripides «in
a bold and disrespectful tone»:

    | «Are these your customs? Is it thus that Greece
    | Rewards her combatants? Shall one man claim
    | The trophies won by thousands?»

Whereupon Alexander snatched a spear from one of his guards
and ran Clitus through the body as he lifted the curtain to come in. . . .

One is forced to believe that this was the real atmosphere
of the young conqueror's life. Then the story of his frantic and cruel display
of grief for Hephaestion can scarcely be all invention. If it is true, or in
any part true, it displays a mind ill-balanced and altogether wrapped up in
personal things, to whom empire was no more than opportunity for egoistic
display and all the resources of the world, stuff for freaks of that sort of
«generosity» which robs a thousand people to extort the admiration of one
astounded recipient.

Hephaestion, being ill, was put upon a strict diet, but in
the absence of his physician at the theatre he ate a roasted fowl and drank a flagon
of iced wine, in consequence of which he died. .

Thereupon Alexander decided upon a display of grief. It was
the grief of a lunatic. He had the physician crucified! He ordered every horse
and mule in Persia to be shorn, and pulled down the battlements of the
neighbouring cities. He prohibited all music in his camp for a long time, and,
having taken certain villages of the Cusaeans, he caused all the adults to be
massacred, as a sacrifice to the manes of Hephaestion. Finally he set aside ten
thousand talents (a talent = £240) for a tomb. For those days this was an
enormous sum of money. None of which things did any real honour to Hephaestion,
but they served to demonstrate to an awe-stricken world what a tremendous thing
the sorrow of Alexander could be.

This last story and many such stories may be lies or
distortions or exaggerations. But they have a vein in common. After a bout of
hard drinking in Babylon a sudden fever came upon Alexander (323 B.C.), and he
sickened and died. He was still only thirty-three years of age. Forthwith the
world empire he had snatched at and held in his hands, as a child might snatch
at and hold a precious vase, fell to the ground and was shattered to pieces.

Whatever appearance of a worldwide order may have gleamed
upon men's imaginations, vanished at his death. The story becomes the story of
a barbaric autocracy in confusion. Everywhere the provincial rulers set up for
themselves. In the course of a few years the entire family of Alexander had
been destroyed. Roxana, his barbarian wife, was prompt to murder, as a rival,
the daughter of Darius. She herself presently bore Alexander a posthumous son,
who was also called Alexander. He was murdered, with her, a few years later
(311 B.C.). Hercules, the only other son of Alexander, was murdered also. So,
too, was Aridaeus, the weak-minded half-brother (see sec 2). Plutarch gives a
last glimpse of Olympias during a brief interval of power in Macedonia,
accusing first this person and then that of poisoning her wonderful son. Many she
killed in her fury. The bodies of some of his circle who had died after his
death she caused to be dug up, but we do not know if any fresh light was shed
upon his death by these disinterments.

Finally Olympias was killed in Macedonia by the friends of
those she had slain.
