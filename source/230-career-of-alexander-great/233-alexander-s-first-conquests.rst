23.3 Alexander's First Conquests
========================================================================
These stories have to be told because history cannot be
understood without them. Here was the great world of men between India and the
Adriatic ready for union, ready as it had never been before for a unifying
control. Here was the wide order of the Persian Empire with its roads, its
posts, its general peace and prosperity, ripe for the fertilizing influence of
the Greek mind. And these stories display the quality of the human beings to
whom those great opportunities came. Here was this Philip who was a very great
and noble man, and yet he was drunken, he could keep no order in his household.
Here was Alexander in many ways gifted above any man of his time, and he was
vain, suspicious, and passionate, with a mind set awry by his mother.

We are beginning to understand something of what the world
might be, something of what our race might become, were it not for our still
raw humanity. It is barely a matter of seventy generations between ourselves
and Alexander; and between ourselves and the savage hunters, our ancestors, who
charred their food in the embers or ate it raw, intervene some four or five
hundred generations. There is not much scope for the modification of a species
in four or five hundred generations. Make men and women only sufficiently
jealous or fearful or drunken or angry, and the hot red eyes of the cavemen
will glare out at us today. We have writing and teaching, science and power; we
have tamed the beasts and schooled the lightning; but we are still only
shambling towards the light. We have tamed and bred the beasts, but we have
still to tame and breed ourselves.

From the very beginning of his reign the deeds of Alexander
showed how well he had assimilated his father's plans, and how great were his
own abilities. A map of the known world is needed to show the course of his
life. At first, after receiving assurances from Greece that he was to be
captain-general of the Grecian forces, he marched through Thrace to the Danube;
he crossed the river and burnt a village, the second great monarch to raid the
Scythian country beyond the Danube; then recrossed it and marched westward and
so came down by Illyria. By that time the city of Thebes was in rebellion, and
his next blow was at Greece. Thebes – unsupported of course by Athens – was taken
and looted; it was treated with extravagant violence; all its buildings, except
the temple and the house of the poet Pindar, were razed, and thirty thousand
people sold into slavery. Greece was stunned, and Alexander was free to go on
with the Persian campaign.

This destruction of Thebes betrayed a streak of violence in
the new master of human destinies. It was too heavy a blow to have dealt. It was
a barbaric thing to do. If the spirit of rebellion was killed, so also was the
spirit of help. The Greek states remained inert thereafter, neither troublesome
nor helpful. They would not support Alexander with their shipping, a thing
which was to prove a very grave embarrassment to him.

There is a story told by Plutarch about this Theban
massacre, as if it redounded to the credit of Alexander, but indeed it shows
only how his saner and his crazy sides were in conflict. It tells of a
Macedonian officer and a Theban lady. This officer was among the looters, and
he entered this woman's house, inflicted unspeakable insults and injuries upon
her, and at last demanded whether she had gold or silver hidden. She told him
all her treasures had been put into the well, conducted him thither, and, as
be stooped to peer down, pushed him suddenly in and killed him by throwing
great stones upon him. Some allied soldiers came upon this scene and took her
forthwith to Alexander for judgment.

She defied him. Already the extravagant impulse that had
ordered the massacre was upon the wane, and he not only spared her, but had her
family and property and freedom restored to her. This Plutarch makes out to be
a generosity, but the issue is more complicated than that. It was Alexander who
was outraging and plundering and enslaving all Thebes. That poor crumpled
Macedonian brute in the well had been doing only what he had been told he had
full liberty to do. Is a commander first to give cruel orders, and then to
forgive and reward those who slay his instruments? This gleam of remorse at the
instance of one woman who was not perhaps wanting in tragic dignity and beauty,
is a poor setoff to the murder of a great city.

Mixed with the craziness of Olympias in Alexander was the
sanity of Philip and the teachings of Aristotle. This Theban business certainly
troubled the mind of Alexander. Whenever afterwards he encountered Thebans, he
tried to show them special favour. Thebes, to his credit, haunted him.

Yet the memory of Thebes did not save three other great
cities from similar brain storms; Tyre he destroyed, and Gaza, and a city in
India, in the storming of which he was knocked down in fair fight and wounded;
and of the latter place not a soul, not a child, was spared. He must have been badly
frightened to have taken so evil a revenge.

At the outset of the war the Persians had this supreme
advantage, they were practically masters of the sea. The ships of the Athenians
and their allies sulked unhelpfully. Alexander, to get at Asia, had to go round
by the Hellespont; and if he pushed far into the Persian empire, he ran the
risk of being cut off completely from his base. His first task, therefore, was
to cripple the enemy at sea, and this he could only do by marching along the
coast of Asia Minor and capturing port after port until the Persian sea bases
were destroyed. If the Persians had avoided battle and hung upon his
lengthening line of communications they could probably have destroyed him, but
this they did not do. A Persian army not very much greater than his own gave
battle on the banks of the Granicus (334 B.C.) and was destroyed. This left him
free to take Sardis, Ephesus, Miletus, and, after a fierce struggle,
Halicarnassus. Meanwhile the Persian fleet was on his right flank and between
him and Greece, threatening much but accomplishing nothing.

In 333 B.C., pursuing this attack upon the sea bases, he
marched along the coast as far as the head of the gulf now called the Gulf of
Alexandretta. A huge Persian army, under the great king Darius III, was inland
of his line of march, separated from the coast by mountains, and Alexander went
right beyond this enemy force before he or the Persians realized their
proximity. Scouting was evidently very badly done by Greek and Persian alike.
The Persian army was a vast, ill-organized assembly of soldiers, transport,
camp followers, and so forth. Darius, for instance, was accompanied by his
harem, and there was a great multitude of harem slaves, musicians, dancers, and
cooks. Many of the leading officers had brought their families to witness the
hunting down of the Macedonian invaders. The troops had been levied from every
province in the empire; they had no tradition or principle of combined action.
Seized by the idea of cutting off Alexander from Greece, Darius moved this
multitude over the mountains to the sea; he had the luck to get through the
passes without opposition, and he encamped on the plain of Issus between the
mountains and the shore. And there Alexander, who had turned back to fight, struck
him. The cavalry charge and the phalanx smashed this great brittle host as a
stone smashes a bottle. It was routed. Darius escaped from his war chariot – that
out-of-date instrument – and fled on horseback, leaving even his harem in the
hands of Alexander.

All the accounts of Alexander after this battle show him at
his best. He was restrained and magnanimous. He treated the Persian princesses
with the utmost civility. And he kept his head; he held steadfastly to his
plan. He let Darius escape, unpursued, into Syria, and he continued his march
upon the naval bases of the Persians – that is to say, upon the Phoenician ports
of Tyre and Sidon.

Sidon surrendered to him; Tyre resisted.

Here, if anywhere, we have the evidence of great military
ability on the part of Alexander. His army was his father's creation, but
Philip had never shone in the siege of cities. When Alexander was a boy of
sixteen, he had seen his father repulsed by the fortified city of Byzantium
upon the Bosphorus. Now he was face to face with an inviolate city which had
stood siege after siege, which had resisted Nebuchadnezzar the Great for
fourteen years.

For the standing of sieges Semitic peoples hold the palm.
Tyre was then an island half a mile from the shore, and her fleet was unbeaten.
On the other hand, Alexander had already learnt much by the siege of the
citadel of Halicarnassus; he had gathered to himself a corps of engineers from
Cyprus and Phoenicia the Sidonian fleet was with him, and presently the king of
Cyprus came over to him with a hundred and twenty ships, which gave him the
command of the sea. Moreover, great Carthage, either relying on the strength of
the mother city or being disloyal to her, and being furthermore entangled in a
war in Sicily, sent no help.

The first measure of Alexander was to build a pier from the
mainland to the island, a dam which remains to this day; and on this, as it
came close to the walls of Tyre, he set up his towers and battering-rams.
Against the walls he also moored ships in which towers and rams were erected.
The Tyrians used fire-ships against this flotilla, and made sorties from their
two harbours. In a big surprise raid that they made on the Cyprian ships they
were caught and badly mauled; many of their ships were rammed, and one big
galley of five banks of oars and one of four were captured outright. Finally a
breach in the walls was made, and the Macedonians, clambering up the debris
from their ships, stormed the city.

The siege had lasted seven months. Gaza held out far two.
In each case there was a massacre, the plundering of the city, and the selling
of the survivors into slavery. Then towards the end of 332 B.C. Alexander
entered Egypt, and the command of the sea was assured. Greece, which all this while
had been wavering in its policy, decided now at last that it was an the side of
Alexander, and the council of the Greek states at Corinth voted its
«captain-general» a golden crown of victory. From this time onward the Greeks
were with the Macedonians.

The Egyptians also were with the Macedonians. But they had
been for Alexander from the beginning. They had lived under Persian rule for
nearly two hundred years, and the coming of Alexander meant for them only a
change of masters; on the whole, a change for the better. The country
surrendered without a blow. Alexander treated its religious feelings with
extreme respect. He unwrapped no mummies as Cambyses had done; he took no
liberties with Apis, the sacred bull of Memphis. Here, in great temples and upon
a vast scale, Alexander found the evidences of a religiosity, mysterious and
irrational, to remind him of the secrets and mysteries that had entertained his
mother and impressed his childhood. During his four months in Egypt he flirted
with religious emotions.

He was still a very young man, we must remember, divided
against himself. The strong sanity he inherited from his father had made him a
great soldier; the teaching of Aristotle had given him something of the
scientific outlook upon the world. He had destroyed Tyre; in Egypt, at one of
the mouths of the Nile, he now founded a new city, Alexandria, to replace that
ancient centre of trade. To the north of Tyre, near Issus, he founded a second
port, Alexandretta. Both of these cities flourish to this day, and for a time
Alexandria was perhaps the greatest city in the world. The sites, therefore,
must have been wisely chosen. But also Alexander had the unstable emotional
imaginativeness of his mother, and side by side with such creative work he
indulged in religious adventures. The gods of Egypt took possession of his
mind. He travelled four hundred miles to the remote oasis of the oracle of
Ammon. He wanted to settle certain doubts about his true parentage. His Mother
had inflamed his mind by hints and vague speeches of some deep mystery about
his parentage. Was so ordinary a human being as Philip of Macedon really his
father?

For nearly four hundred years Egypt, had been a country
politically contemptible, overrun now by Ethiopians, now by Assyrians, now by
Babylonians, now by Persians. As the indignities of the present became more and
more disagreeable to contemplate, the past and the other world became more
splendid to Egyptian eyes. It is from the festering humiliations of peoples
that arrogant religious propagandas spring. To the triumphant the downtrodden
can say, «It is naught in the sight of the true gods». So the son of Philip of
Macedon, the master-general of Greece, was made to feel a small person amidst
the gigantic temples. And he had an abnormal share of youth's normal ambition
to impress everybody. How gratifying then for him to discover presently that he
was no mere successful mortal, not one of these modern vulgar Greekish folk,
but ancient and divine, the son of a god, the Pharaoh god, son of Ammon Ra!

Already in a previous chapter we have given a description
of that encounter in the desert temple.

Not altogether was the young man convinced. He had his
moments of conviction; he had his saner phases when the thing was almost a
jest. In the presence of Macedonians and Greeks he doubted if he was divine.
When it thundered loudly, the ribald Aristarchus could ask him: «Won't
*you* do something of the sort, oh Son of
Zeus?» But the crazy notion was, nevertheless, present henceforth in his brain,
ready to be inflamed by wine or flattery.

Next spring (331 B.C.) he returned to Tyre, and marched
thence round towards Assyria, leaving the Syrian desert on his right. Near the
ruins of forgotten Nineveh he found a great Persian army, that had been
gathering since the battle of Issus, awaiting him. It was another huge medley
of contingents, and it relied for its chief force upon that now antiquated
weapon, the war chariot. Of these Darius had a force of two hundred, and each
chariot had scythes attached to its wheels and to the pole and body of the
chariot. There seem to have been four horses to each chariot, and it will be
obvious that if one of those horses was wounded by javelin or arrow, that
chariot was held up. The outer horses acted chiefly as buffers for the inner
wheel horses; they were hitched to the chariot by a single outside trace which
could be easily cut away, but the loss of one of the wheel horses completely
incapacitated the whole affair. Against broken footmen or a crowd of
individualist fighters such vehicles might be formidable; but Darius began the
battle by flinging them against the cavalry and light infantry. Few reached
their objective, and those that did were readily disposed of. There was some
manoeuvring for position. The well-drilled Macedonians moved obliquely across
the Persian front, keeping good order; the Persians, following this movement to
the flank, opened gaps in their array. Then suddenly the disciplined Macedonian
cavalry charged at one of these torn places and smote the centre of the Persian
host. The infantry followed close upon their charge. The centre and left of the
Persians crumpled up. For a while the light cavalry on the Persian right gained
ground against Alexander's left, only to be cut to pieces by the cavalry from Thessaly,
which by this time had become almost as good as its Macedonian model. The
Persian forces ceased to resemble an army. They dissolved into a vast multitude
of fugitives streaming under great dust clouds and without a single rally
across the hot plain towards Arbela. Through the dust and the flying crowd rode
the victors, slaying and slaying until darkness stayed the slaughter. Darius
led the retreat.

Such was the battle of Arbela. It was fought on October the
1st, 331 B.C. We know its date so exactly, because it is recorded that, eleven
days before it began, the soothsayers on both sides had been greatly exercised
by an eclipse of the moon.

Darius fled to the north into the country of the Medes.
Alexander marched on to Babylon. The ancient city of Hammurabi (who had reigned
seventeen hundred years before) and of Nebuchadnezzar the Great and of
Nabonidus was still, unlike Nineveh, a prosperous and important centre. Like
the Egyptians, the Babylonians were not greatly concerned at a change of rule
to Macedonian from Persian. The temple of Bel-Marduk was in ruins, a quarry for
building material, but the tradition of the Chaldean priests still lingered,
and Alexander promised to restore the building.

Thence he marched on to Susa, once the chief city of the vanished
and forgotten Elamites, and now the Persian capital.

He went on to Persepolis, where, as the climax of a drunken
carouse, he burnt down the great palace of the king of kings. This he
afterwards declared was the revenge of Greece for the burning of Athens by
Xerxes.
