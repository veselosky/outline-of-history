23.8 Alexander as a Portent of World Unity
========================================================================
Nearly all historians are disposed to regard the career of
Alexander the Great as marking an epoch in human affairs. It drew together all
the known world, excepting only the western Mediterranean, into one drama. But
the opinions men have formed of Alexander himself vary enormously. They fall,
most of them, into two main schools. One type of scholar is fascinated by the
youth and splendour of this young man. These Alexander-worshippers seem
disposed to take him at his own valuation, to condone every crime and folly
either as the mere ebullience of a rich nature or as the bitter necessity to
some gigantic scheme, and to regard his life as framed upon a design, a scheme
of statesmanship, such as all the wider knowledge and wider ideas of these
later times barely suffice to bring into the scope of our understanding. On the
other hand, there are those who see him only as a wrecker of the slowly
maturing possibilities of a free and tranquil Hellenized world.

Before we ascribe to Alexander or to his father Philip,
schemes of world policy such as a twentieth-century historian-philosopher might
approve, we shall do well to consider very carefully the utmost range of
knowledge and thought that was possible in those days. The world of Plato,
Isocrates, and Aristotle had practically no historical perspective at all–there
had not been such a thing as history in the world, history, that is, as
distinguished from mere priestly chronicles, until the last couple of
centuries. Even highly educated men had the most circumscribed ideas of
geography and foreign countries. For most men the world was still flat and
limitless. The only systematic political philosophy was based on the
experiences of minute city-states, and took no thought of empires. Nobody knew
anything of the origins of civilization. No one had speculated upon economics
before that time. No one had worked out the reaction of one social class upon
another. We are too apt to consider the career of Alexander as the crown of
some process that had long been afoot, as the climax of a crescendo. In a
sense, no doubt, it was that; but much more true is it that it was not so much
an end as a beginning; it was the first revelation to the human imagination of
the oneness of human affairs. The utmost reach of the thought of Greece before
his time was of a Persian Empire Hellenized, a predominance in the world of
Macedonians and Greeks. But before Alexander was dead, and much more after he
was dead and there had been time to think him over, the conception of a world
law and organization was a practicable and assimilable idea for the minds of
men.

For some generations Alexander the Great was for mankind
the symbol and embodiment of world order and world dominion. He became a
fabulous being. His head, adorned with the divine symbols of the demi-god
Hercules or the god Ammon Ra, appears on the coins of such among his successors
as could claim to be his heirs. Then the idea of world dominion was taken up by
another great people, a people who for some centuries exhibited considerable
political genius, the Romans; and the figure of another conspicuous adventurer,
Caesar, eclipsed for the western half of the old world the figure of Alexander.

So by the beginning of the third century B.C. we find
already arisen in the Western civilization of the old world three of the great
structural ideas that rule the mind of contemporary mankind. We have already
traced the escape of writing and knowledge from the secrets and mysteries and
initiations of the old-world priesthoods, and the development of the idea of a
universal knowledge, of a universally understandable and communicable history
and philosophy. We have taken the figures of Herodotus and Aristotle as typical
exponents of this first great idea, the idea of
*science* – using the word science in its widest and properest sense,
to include history and signify a clear vision of man in relation to the things
about him. We have traced also the generalization of religion among the
Babylonians, Jews, and other Semitic peoples, from the dark worship in temples
and consecrated places of some local or tribal god to the open service of
*one universal God of Righteousness,*
whose temple is the whole world. And now we have traced also the first
germination of the idea of a *world
polity.* The rest of the history of mankind is very largely the history of
those three ideas of science, of a universal righteousness, and of a human
commonweal, spreading out from the minds of the rare and exceptional persons
and peoples in which they first originated, into the general consciousness of
the race, and giving first a new colour, then a new spirit, and then a new
direction to human affairs.
