    Figure 804: Britain, France, and Spain in America, 1750

    Note: Shading does not indicate areas actually settled, but general extent of territories claimed.

We have given some account of the ascendancy of France in Europe, the swift
decay of the sappy growth of Spanish power and its, separation from Austria, and
the rise of Prussia. So far as Portugal, Spain, France, Britain, and Holland
were concerned, their competition for ascendancy in Europe was extended and
complicated by a struggle for dominion overseas.

The discovery of the huge continent of America, thinly inhabited,
undeveloped, and admirably adapted for European settlement and exploitation, the
simultaneous discovery of great areas of unworked country south of the torrid
equatorial regions of Africa that had hitherto limited European knowledge, and
the gradual realization of vast island regions in the Eastern seas, as yet
untouched by Western civilization, was a presentation of opportunity to mankind
unprecedented in all history. It was as if the peoples of Europe had come into
some splendid legacy. Their world had suddenly quadrupled. There was more than
enough for all; they had only to take these lands and continue to do well by
them, and their crowded poverty would vanish like a dream. And they received
this glorious legacy like ill-bred heirs; it meant no more to them than a fresh
occasion for atrocious disputes. But what community of human beings has ever yet
preferred creation to conspiracy? What nation in all our story has ever worked
with another when, at any cost to itself, it could contrive to do that other an
injury? The Powers of Europe began by a frantic «claiming» of the new realms.
They went on to exhausting conflicts. Spain, who claimed first and most, and who
was for a time «mistress» of two-thirds of America, made no better use of her
possession than to bleed herself nearly to death therein.

We have told how the Papacy in its last assertion of world dominion, instead
of maintaining the common duty of all Christendom to make a great common
civilization in the new lands, divided the American continent between Spain and
Portugal. This naturally roused the hostility of the excluded nations. The
seamen of England showed no respect for either claim, and set themselves
particularly against the Spanish; the Swedes turned their Protestantism to a
similar account. The Hollanders, so soon as they had shaken off their Spanish
masters, also set their sails westward to flout the Pope and share in the good
things of the new world. His Most Catholic Majesty of France hesitated as little
as any Protestant. All these powers were soon busy staking out claims in North
America and the West Indies.

Neither the Danish kingdom (which at that time included Norway and Iceland)
nor the Swedes secured very much in the scramble. The Danes annexed some of the
West Indian islands. Sweden got nothing. Both Denmark and Sweden at this time
were deep in the affairs of Germany. We have already named Gustavus Adolphus,
the Protestant «Lion of the North», and mentioned his campaigns in Germany,
Poland, and Russia. These Eastern European regions are great absorbents of
energy, and the strength that might have given Sweden a large share in the new
world reaped a barren harvest of glory in Europe. Such small settlements as the
Swedes made in America presently fell to the Dutch.

The Hollanders too, with the French monarchy under Cardinal Richelieu and
under Louis XIV eating its way across the Spanish Netherlands towards their,
frontier, had not the undistracted resources that Britain, behind her «silver
streak» of sea, could put into overseas adventures.

Moreover, the absolutist efforts of James I and Charles I, and the
restoration of Charles II, had the effect of driving out from England a great
number of sturdy-minded, republican-inspirited Protestants', men of substance
and character, who set up in America, and particularly in Now England, out of
reach, as they supposed, of the king and his taxes. The Mayflower was only one
of the pioneer vessels of a stream of emigrants. It was the luck of Britain that
they remained, though dissentient in spirit, under the British flag. The Dutch
never sent out settlers of the same quantity and quality, first because their
Spanish rulers would not, let them, and then because they had got possession of
their own country. And though there was a great emigration of Protestant
Huguenots from the dragonnades and persecution of Louis XIV, they had Holland
and England close at hand as refuges, and their industry, skill, and sobriety
went mainly to strengthen those countries, and particularly England. A few of
them founded settlements in Carolina, but these did not remain French; they fell
first to the Spanish and finally to the English.

The Dutch settlements, with the Swedish, also succumbed to Britain; Nieuw
Amsterdam became British in 1674, and its name was changed to New York, as the
reader may learn very cheerfully in Washington Irving's *Knickerbockers
History of New York.* The state of affairs in North America in 1750 is
indicated very clearly by a map we have adapted from one in Robinson's
*Medieval and Modern Times.* The British power was established along the
east coast from Savannah to the St. Lawrence River, and Newfoundland and
considerable northern areas, the Hudson Bay Company territories, had been
acquired by treaty from the French. The British occupied Barbados (almost our
oldest possession) in 1605, and acquired Jamaica, the Bahamas, and British
Honduras from the Spaniards. But France was pursuing a very dangerous and
alarming game, a game even more dangerous and alarming on the map than in
reality.

She had made real settlements in Quebec and Montreal to the north and at Now
Orleans in the south, and her explorers and agents had pushed south and north,
making treaties with the American Indians of the great plains and setting, up
claims without setting up towns right across the continent behind the British.
But the realities of the case are not adequately represented in this way. The
British colonies were being very solidly settled by a good class of people; they
already numbered a population of over a million; the French at that time hardly
counted a tenth of that. They had a number of brilliant travelers and
missionaries at work, but no substance of population behind them.

Many old maps of America in this period are still to be found, maps designed
to scare and «rouse» the British to a sense of the «designs of France» in
America. War broke out in 1754, and in 1759 the British and Colonial forces
under General Wolfe took Quebec and completed the conquest of Canada in the next
year. In 1763 Canada was finally ceded to Britain. (But the western part of the
rather indefinite region of Louisiana in the south, named after Louis XIV,
remained outside the British sphere. It was taken over by Spain; and in 1800 it
was recovered by France. Finally, in 1803, it was bought from France by the
United States government.) In this Canadian war the American colonists gained a
considerable experience of the military art, and knowledge of British military
organization that was to be of great use to them a little later.
