            <p>At the end of the first World War, famed writer and futurist H. G. Wells embarked on a project to explain the entirety of human history in a single narrative flow. In 1920, the work was published as two bound volumes entitled <cite>The Outline of History</cite>. The History seems to have struck a chord with the reader of the day. With the horrors of the Great War still fresh in mind, and it's consequences deeply effecting one's daily life, perhaps an interpretive explanation of the arc that brought civilization to such a state was a comfort. Regardless of reasons, the book became quite popular and is in fact still in print (you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0781206618?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mindvessel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0781206618">order Outline Of History (1 Volume) from Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mindvessel-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0781206618" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and used copies abound).</p>
