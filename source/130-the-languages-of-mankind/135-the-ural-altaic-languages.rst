13.5 The Ural-Altaic Languages
================================================================

Across to the north-east of the Aryan and Semitic areas there must once have
spread a further distinct language system which is now represented by a group
of languages known as the TURANIAN, or URAL-ALTAIC group. This includes the
Lappish of Lapland and the Samoyed speech of Siberia, the Finnish language
Magyar, Turkish or Tartar, Manchu and Mongol; it has not as a group been so
exhaustively studied by European philologists, and there is insufficient
evidence yet whether it does or does not include the Korean and Japanese
languages. H. B. Hulbert has issued a comparative grammar of Korean and
certain of the Dravidian languages of India to demonstrate the close affinity
he finds between them.
