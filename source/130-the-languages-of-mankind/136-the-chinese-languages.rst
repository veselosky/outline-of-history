13.6 The Chinese Languages
================================================================

A fifth region of language formation was south-eastern Asia, where there
still prevails a group of languages consisting of monosyllables without any
inflections, in which the tone used in uttering a word determines its
meaning. This may be called the Chinese or MONOSYLLABIC group, and it
includes Chinese, Burmese, Siamese, and Tibetan. The difference between any
of these Chinese tongues and the more western languages is profound. In the
Pekinese form of Chinese there are only about 420 primary monosyllables, and
consequently each of these has to do duty for a great number of things, and
the different meanings are indicated either by the context or by saying the
word in a distinctive tone. The relations of these words to each other are
expressed by quite different methods from the Aryan methods; Chinese grammar
is a thing different in nature from English grammar; it is a separate and
different invention. Many writers declare there is no Chinese grammar at all,
and that is true if we mean by grammar anything in the European sense of
inflections and concords. Consequently any such thing as a literal
translation from Chinese into English is an impossibility. The very method of
the thought is different.\ [#fn2]_ Their philosophy remains still largely a
sealed book to the European on this account and vice versa, because of the
different nature of the expressions.

.. [#fn2] The four characters indicating "Affairs, query, imperative, old," placed
    in that order, for example, represent "Why walk in the ancient ways?" The
    Chinaman gives the bare cores of his meaning; the Englishman gets to it by a
    bold metaphor. He may be talking of conservatism in cooking or book-binding,
    but he will say: "Why walk in the ancient ways?" Mr. Arthur Waley, in the
    interesting essay on Chinese thought and poetry which precedes his book, :t:`170
    Chinese Poems` (Constable, 1918), makes it clear how in these fields Chinese
    thought is kept practical and restricted by the limitations upon metaphor the
    contracted structure of Chinese imposes

    other groups.
