13.9 Some Isolated Languages
================================================================
The Hottentot language is said to have affinities with the Hamitic tongues,
from which it is separated by the whole breadth of Bantu-speaking Central
Africa. A Hottentot-like language with Bushman affinities is still spoken in
equatorial East Africa, and this strengthens the idea that the whole of East
Africa was once Hamitic-speaking. The Bantu languages and peoples spread, in
comparatively recent times, from some centre of origin in West Central Africa
and cut off the Hottentots from the other Hamitic peoples. But it is at least
equally probable that the Hottentot is a separate language group.

Among other remote and isolated little patches of language are the Papuan
speech of New Guinea and the native Australian. The now extinct Tasmanian
language is but little known. What we do know of it is in support of what we
have guessed about the comparative speechlessness of Paleolithic man.

We may quote a passage from Hutchinson's :t:`Living Races of Mankind` upon this
matter:

    «The language of the natives is irretrievably lost, only imperfect
    indications of its structure and a small proportion of its words having been
    preserved. In the absence of sibilants and some other features, their
    dialects resembled the Australian, but were of ruder, of less developed
    structure, and so imperfect that, according to Joseph Milligan, our best
    authority on the subject, they observed no settled order or arrangement of
    words in the construction of their sentences, but conveyed in a supplementary
    fashion by tone, manner, and gesture those modifications of meaning which we
    express by mood, tense, number, etc. Abstract terms were rare; for every
    variety of gum-tree or wattle-tree there was a name, but no word, for 'tree'
    in general, nor for qualities such as hard, soft, warm, cold, long, short,
    round, etc. Anything hard was 'like a stone,' anything round 'like the moon,'
    and so on, usually suiting the action to the word and confirming by some sign
    the meaning to be understood.»
