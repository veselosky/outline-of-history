40.3 Some Fundamental Characteristics of a Modern World State
========================================================================
The attainment of the world state may be impeded and may be opposed to-day by
many apparently vast forces; but it has, urging it on, a much more powerful
force, that of the free and growing common intelligence of mankind. To-day there
is in the world a small but increasing number of men, historians,
archaeologists, ethnologists, economists, sociologists, psychologists,
educationists, and the like, who, are doing for human institutions that same
task of creative analysis which the scientific men, of the seventeenth and
eighteenth century did for the materials and mechanism of human life; and just
as these latter, almost unaware of what they were doing, made telegraphy, swift
transit on sea and land, flying and a thousand hitherto impossible: things
possible, so the former may be doing more than the world suspects, or than they
themselves suspect, to clear-up and make plain the thing to do and the way to do
it, in the greater and more urgent human affairs.

Let us ape Roger Bacon in his prophetic mood, and set down what we believe
will be the broad fundamentals of the coming world state.

(i) It will be based upon a common world religion, very much simplified and
universalized and better understood. This will not be Christianity nor Islam nor
Buddhism nor any such specialized form of religion, but religion itself pure and
undefiled; the Eightfold Way, the Kingdom of Heaven, brotherhood, creative
service, and self-forgetfulness. Throughout the world, men's thoughts and
motives will be turned by education, example, and the circle of ideas about
them, from the obsession of self to the cheerful service of human knowledge,
human power, and human unity.

(ii) And this world state will be sustained by a universal education,
organized upon a scale and of a penetration and quality beyond all present
experience. The whole race, and not simply classes and peoples, will be
*educated.* Most parents will have a technical knowledge of teaching. Quite
apart from the duties of parentage, perhaps ten per cent or more of the adult
population will, at some time or other in their lives, be workers in the world's
educational organization. And education, as the new age will conceive it, will
go on throughout life; it will not cease at any particular age. Men and women
will simply become self-educators and individual students and student teachers
as they grow older.

(iii) There will be no armies, no navies, and no classes of unemployed people
either wealthy or poor.

(iv) The world state's organization of scientific research and record
compared with that of to-day will be like an ocean liner beside the dug-out
canoe of some early heliolithic wanderer.

\(v) There will be a vast free literature of criticism and discussion.

(vi) The world's political organization will be democratic, that is to say,
the government and direction of affairs will be in immediate touch with and
responsive to the general thought of the educated whole population.

(vii) Its economic organization will be an exploitation of all natural wealth
and every fresh possibility science reveals, by the agents and servants of the
common government for the common good. Private enterprise will be the servant—a
useful, valued, and well-rewarded servant—and no longer the robber master of the
commonweal.

(viii) And this implies two achievements that seem very difficult to us
to-day. They are matters of mechanism, but they are as essential to the world's
well-being as it is to a soldier's, no matter how brave he may be, that his
machine gun should not jam, and to an aeronaut's that his steering-gear should
not fail him in mid-air. Political well-being demands that electoral methods
shall be used, and economic well-being requires that a currency shall be used,
safeguarded or proof against the contrivances and manipulations of clever,
dishonest men.\ [#fn1]_
