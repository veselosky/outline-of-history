26.4 The First Punic War
========================================================================
It would be interesting, and not altogether idle, to
speculate what might have happened to mankind if Rome and Carthage could have
settled their differences and made a permanent alliance in the Western world.
If Alexander the Great had lived, he might have come westward and driven these
two powers into such a fusion of interests. But that would not have suited the
private schemes and splendours of the Carthaginian oligarchy, and the new
Senate of greater Rome was now growing fond of the taste of plunder and casting
covetous eyes across the Straits of Messina upon the Carthaginian possessions
in Sicily. They were covetous, but they were afraid of the Carthaginian sea
power, Roman popular «patriotism», however, was also jealous and fearful of
these Carthaginians, and less inclined to count the cost of a conflict. The
alliance Pyrrhus had forced upon Rome and Carthage held good for eleven years,
but Rome was ripe for what is called in modern political jargon an «offensive
defensive» war. The occasion arose in 264 B.C.

At that time Sicily was not completely in Carthaginian
hands. The eastward end was still under the power of the Greek king of
Syracuse, Hiero, a successor of that Dionysius to whom Plato had gone as
resident court philosopher. A hand of mercenaries who had been in the service
of Syracuse seized upon Messina (289 B.C.), and raided the trade of Syracuse so
that at last Hiero, was forced to take measures to suppress them (270 B.C.).
There upon Carthage, which was also vitally concerned in the suppression of
piracy, came to his aid, and put in a Carthaginian garrison at Messina. This
was an altogether justifiable proceeding. Now that Tyre had been destroyed, the
only capable guardian of sea law in the Mediterranean was Carthage, and the
suppression of piracy was her task by habit and tradition.

The pirates of Messina appealed to Rome, and the
accumulating jealousy and fear of Carthage decided the Roman people to help
them. An expedition was dispatched to Messina under the consul Appius Claudius
(the third Appius Claudius we have had to mention in this history).

So began the first of the most wasteful and disastrous
series of wars that has ever darkened the history of mankind. But this is how
one historian, soaked with the fantastic political ideas of our times, is
pleased to write of this evil expedition. «The Romans knew they were entering
on war with Carthage; but the political instincts of the people were right, for
a Carthaginian garrison on the Sicilian Straits would have been a dangerous
menace to the peace of Italy». So they protected the peace of Italy from this
«menace» by a war that lasted nearly a quarter of a century. They wrecked their
own slowly acquired political moral in the process.

The Romans captured Messina, and Hiero deserted from the
Carthaginians to the Romans. Then for some time the struggle centered upon the
town Agrigentum. This, the Romans besieged, and a period of trench warfare
ensued. Both sides suffered greatly from plague and irregular supplies; the
Romans lost 30,000 men; but in the end (261 B.C.) the Carthaginians evacuated
the place and retired to their fortified towns on the western coast of the
island of which Lilybaeum was the chief. These they could supply easily from
the African mainland, and, as long as their sea ascendancy held, they could
exhaust any Roman effort against them.

And now a new and very extraordinary phase of the war
began. The Romans came out upon the sea, and to the astonishment of the
Carthaginians and themselves defeated the Carthaginian fleet. Since the days of
Salamis there had been a considerable development of naval architecture. Then
the ruling type of battleship was a trireme, a galley with three banks (rows)
of oars; now the leading Carthaginian battleship was a quinquereme, a much
bigger galley with five banks of oars, which could ram or shear the oars of any
feebler vessel. The Romans had come into the war with no such shipping. Now
they set to work to build quinqueremes, being helped, it is said, in their
designing by one of these Carthaginian vessels coming ashore. In two months
they built a hundred quinqueremes and thirty triremes. But they had no skilled
navigators, no experienced oarsmen, and these deficiencies they remedied partly
with the assistance of their Greek allies and partly by the invention of new
tactics. Instead of relying upon ramming or breaking the oars of the adversary,
which demanded more seamanship than they possessed, they decided to board the
enemy, and they constructed a sort of long draw-bridge on their ships, held up
to a mast by a pulley and with grappling-hooks and spikes at the end. They also
loaded their galleys with soldiers. Then as the Carthaginian rammed or swept
alongside, this corvus, as it was called, could be let down and the boarders
could swarm aboard him.

Simple as this device was, it proved a complete success. It
changed the course of the war and the fate of the world. The small amount of
invention needed to counteract the corvus was not apparently within the compass
of the Carthaginian rulers. At the battle of Mylae (260 B.C.) the Romans gained
their first naval victory and captured or destroyed fifty vessels.

At the great battle of Ecnomus (256 B.C.), «probably the
greatest naval engagement of antiquity»,\ [#fn4]_  in which seven or eight hundred
big ships were engaged, the Carthaginians showed that they had learnt nothing
from their former disaster. According to, rule they outmanoeuvred and defeated
the Romans, but the corvus again defeated them. The Romans sank thirty vessels
and captured sixty-four.

Thereafter the war continued with violent fluctuations of
fortune, but with a continuous demonstration of the greater energy, solidarity,
and initiative of the Romans. After Ecnomus the Romans invaded Africa by sea,
and sent an insufficiently supported army, which after many successes and the
capture of Tunis (within ten miles of Carthage) was completely defeated. They
lost their sea ascendancy through a storm, and regained it by building a second
fleet of two hundred and twenty ships within three months. They captured
Palermo, and defeated a great Carthaginian army there (251 B.C.), capturing one
hundred and four elephants, and making such a triumphal procession into Rome as
that city had never seen before. They made an unsuccessful siege of Lilybaeum,
the chief surviving Carthaginian stronghold in Sicily. They lost their second
fleet in a great naval battle at Drepanum. (249 B.C.), losing one hundred and
eighty out of two hundred and ten vessels; and a third fleet of one hundred and
twenty battle ships and eight hundred transports was lost in the same year
partly in battle and partly in a storm.

For seven years a sort of war went on between the nearly
exhausted combatants, a war of raids and feeble sieges, during which the
Carthaginians had the best of it at sea. Then by a last supreme effort Rome
launched a fourth fleet of two hundred keels, and defeated the last strength of
the Carthaginians at the battle of the Aegatian Isles (241 B.C.), after which
Carthage (240 B.C.) sued for peace.

By the terms of this peace, all Sicily, except for the
dominions of Hiero of Syracuse, became an «estate» of the Roman people. There
was no such process, of assimilation as had been practised in Italy; Sicily
became a conquered province, paying tribute and yielding profit like the
provinces of the older empires. And, in addition, Carthage paid a war indemnity
of 3,200 talents (= £788,000).
