26.2 A New Sort of State
========================================================================
But we write «Rome» and the «Romans», and we have still to
explain what manner of people these were who were playing a role of conquest
that had hither-to been played only by able and aggressive monarchs.

Their state was, in the fifth Century B.C., a republic of
the Aryan type very similar to a Greek aristocratic republic. The earliest
accounts of the social life of Rome give us a picture of a very primitive Aryan
community «In the second half of the fifth century before Christ, Rome was
still an aristocratic community of free peasants, occupying an area of nearly
400 square miles, with a population certainly not exceeding 150,000, almost
entirely dispersed over the country-side and divided into seventeen districts or
rural tribes. Most of the families had a small holding and a cottage of their
own, where father and sons lived and worked together, growing corn for the most
part, with here and there a strip of vine or olive. Their few head of cattle
were kept at pasture on the neighbouring common land; their clothes and simple
implements of husbandry they made for themselves at home. Only at rare
intervals and on special occasions would they make their way into the fortified
town, which was the centre at once of their religion and their government.

Here were the temples of the gods, the houses of the
wealthy, and the shops of the artisans and traders, where corny oil, or wine
could he bartered in small quantities for salt or rough tools and weapons of
iron».\ [#fn2]_

This community followed the usual tradition of a division
into aristocratic and common citizens, who were called in Rome patricians and
plebeians. These were the citizens; the slave or outlander had no more part in
the state than he had in Greece. But the constitution differed from any Greek
constitution in the fact that a great part of the ruling power was gathered
into the hands of a body called the Senate, which was neither purely a body of
hereditary members nor directly an elected and representative one. It was a
nominated one, and in the earlier period it was nominated solely from among the
patricians. It existed before the expulsion of the kings, and in the time of
the kings it was the king who nominated the senators. But after the expulsion
of the kings (510 B.C.), the supreme government was vested in the hands of two
elected rulers, the consuls; and it was the consuls who took over the business
of appointing senators. In the early days of the Republic only patricians were
eligible as consuls or senators, and the share of the plebeians in the
government consisted merely in a right to vote for the consuls and other public
officials. Even for that purpose their votes did not have the same value as
those of their patrician fellow citizens. But their votes had at any rate
sufficient weight to induce many of the patrician candidates to profess a more
or less sincere concern for plebeian grievances. In the early phases of the
Roman state, moreover, the plebeians were not only excluded from public office,
but from intermarriage with the patrician class. The administration was
evidently primarily a patrician affair.

The early phase of Roman affairs was therefore an
aristocracy of a very pronounced type, and the internal history of Rome for the
two centuries and a half between the expulsion of the last Etruscan king,
Tarquin the Proud, and the beginning of the first Punic War (264 B.C.), was
very largely a struggle for mastery between those two orders, the patricians
and the plebeians. It, was, in fact, closely parallel with the struggle of
aristocracy and democracy in the city states of Greece, and, as in the case of
Greece, there were whole classes in the community, slaves, freed slaves,
unpropertied free men, outlanders, and the like, who were entirely outside and
beneath the struggle. We have already noted the essential difference of Greek
democracy and what is called democracy in the world today. Another misused word
is the Roman term Proletariat, which in modem jargon means all the unpropertied
people, in a modern state. In Rome the Proletarii were a voting division of
fully qualified citizens whose property was less than 10,000 copper asses (=
£275). They were an enrolled class; their value to the state consisted in their
raising families of citizens, (proles = offspring), and from their ranks were
drawn the colonists who went to form new Latin cities or to garrison important
points. But the proletarii were quite distinct in origin from slaves or
freedmen or the miscellaneous driftage of a town slum, and it is a great pity
that modern political discussion should be confused by an inaccurate use of a
term which has no exact modern equivalent and which expresses nothing real in
modern social classification.

The mass of the details of this struggle between patricians
and plebeians we can afford to ignore in this outline. It was a struggle which
showed the Romans to be a people of a curiously shrewd character, never forcing
things to a destructive crisis, but being within the limits of their discretion
grasping hard dealers. The patricians made a mean use of their political
advantages to grow rich through the national conquests at the expense not only
of the defeated enemy, but of the poorer plebeian, whose farm had been
neglected and who had fallen into debt during his military service. The plebeians
were ousted from any share in the conquered lands, which the patricians divided
up among themselves. The introduction of money probably increased the
facilities of the usurer and the difficulties of the borrowing debtor.

Three sorts of pressure won the plebeians a greater share
in the government of the country and the good things that were coming to Rome
as she grew powerful. The first of these (1) was the general strike of
plebeians. Twice they actually marched right out of Rome, threatening to make a
new city higher up the Tiber, and twice this threat proved conclusive. The
second method of pressure (2) was the threat of a tyranny. Just as in Attica
(the little state of which Athens was the capital), Peisistratus, raised
himself to power on the support of the poorer districts, so there was to be
found in most periods of plebeian discontent some ambitious man ready to figure
as a leader and wrest power from the Senate. For a long time the Roman
patricians were clever enough to beat every such potential tyrant by giving in
to a certain extent to the plebeians. And finally (3) there were patricians big-minded
and far-seeing enough to insist upon the need of reconciliation with the
plebeians.

Thus in 509 B.C., Valerius Poplicola (3), the consul,
enacted that whenever the life or rights of any citizen were at stake, there
should be an appeal from the magistrates to the general assembly. This Lex
Valeria was «the Habeas Corpus of Rome», and it freed the Roman plebeians from
the worst dangers of class vindictiveness in the law courts.

In 464 B.C. occurred a strike (1). «After the Latin war the
pressure of debt had become excessive, and the plebeians saw with indignation
their friends, who had often served the state bravely in the legions, thrown
into chains and reduced to slavery at the demand of patrician creditors. War
was raging against the Volsians; but the legionaries, on their victorious
return, refused any longer to obey the consuls, and marched, though without any
disorder, to the Sacred Mount beyond the Anio (up the Tiber). There they
prepared to found a new city, since the rights of citizens were denied to them
in the old one.

The patricians were compelled to give way, and. the
plebeians, returning to Rome from the «First Secession», received the privilege
of having officers of their own, tribunes and aediles».\ [#fn3]_ 

In 486 B.C. arose Spurius Cassius (2), a consul who carried
an Agrarian Law securing public land for the plebeians. But the next year he
was accused of aiming at royal power, and condemned to death. His law never
came into operation.

There followed a long struggle on the part of the plebeians
to have the laws of Rome written down, so that they would no longer have to
trust to patrician memories. In 451-450 B.C. the law of the Twelve Tables was
published, the basis of all Roman law.

But in order that the Twelve Tables should be formulated, a
committee of ten (the *decemvirate)*
was appointed in the place of the ordinary magistrates. A second decemvirate,
appointed in succession to the first, attempted a sort of aristocratic
counter-revolution under Appius Claudius. The plebeians withdrew again a second
time to the Sacred Mount, and Appius Claudius committed suicide in prison.

In 440 came a famine, and a second attempt to found a popular
tyranny upon the popular wrongs, by Spurius Maelius, a wealthy plebeian, which
ended in his assassination.

After the sack of Rome by the Gauls (390 B.C.), Marcus
Manlius, who had been in command of the Capitol when the geese had saved it,
came forward as a popular leader. The plebeians were suffering severely from
the after-war usury and profiteering of the patricians, and were incurring
heavy debts in rebuilding and restocking their farms. Manlius spent his fortune
in releasing debtors. He was accused by the patricians of tyrannous intentions,
condemned, and suffered the fate of condemned traitors in Rome, being flung
from the Tarpeian Rock, the precipitous edge of that same Capitoline Hill he
had defended.

In 376 B.C., Licinius, who was one of the ten tribunes for
the people, began a long struggle with the patricians by making certain
proposals called the Licinian Rogations, that there should be a limit to the
amount of public land taken by any single citizen, so leaving some for
everybody, that outstanding debts should be forgiven without interest upon the
repayment of the principal, and that henceforth one at least of the two consuls
should be a plebeian.

This precipitated a ten-year struggle. The plebeian power
to stop business by the veto of their representatives, the tribunes, was fully
exercised. In cases of national extremity it was the custom to set all other
magistrates aside and appoint one leader, the Dictator. Rome had done such a
thing during times of military necessity before, but now the patricians set up
a Dictator in a time of profound peace, with the idea of crushing Licinius
altogether. They appointed Camillus, who had besieged and taken Veii from the
Etruscans. But Camillus was a wiser man than his supporters; he brought about a
compromise between the two orders in which most of the demands of the plebeians
were conceded (366 B.C.), dedicated a temple to Concord, and resigned his
power.

Thereafter the struggle between the orders abated. It
abated because, among other influences, the social differences between
patricians and plebeians were diminishing. Trade was coming to Rome with
increasing political power, and many plebeians were growing rich and many
patricians becoming relatively poor. Intermarriage had been rendered possible
by a change in the law, and social intermixture was going on. While the rich
plebeians were becoming, if not aristocratic, at least oligarchic in habits and
sympathy, new classes were springing up in Rome with, fresh interests and no
political standing. Particularly abundant were the freedmen, slaves set free,
for the most part artisans, but some of them traders, who were growing wealthy.
And the Senate, no longer a purely patrician body-since various official
positions were now open to plebeians, and such plebeian officials became
senators-was becoming now an assembly of all the wealthy, able, energetic, and
influential men in the state. The Roman power was expanding, and as it expanded
these old class oppositions of the early Latin community were becoming unmeaning.
They were being replaced by new associations and new antagonisms. Rich men of
all origins were being drawn together into a common interest against the
communistic ideas of the poor.

In 390 B.C. Rome was a miserable little city on the borders
of Etruria, being sacked by the Gauls; in 275 B.C. she was ruling and unifying
all Italy, from the Arno to the Straits of Messina. The compromise of Camillus
(367 B.C.) had put an end to internal dissensions, and left her energies free
for expansion. And the same queer combination of sagacity and aggressive
selfishness that had distinguished the war of her orders at home, and enabled
her population to worry out a balance of power without any catastrophe marks
her policy abroad. She understood the value of Allies; she could assimilate;
abroad as at home she could in those days at least «give and take» with a
certain fairness and sanity. There lay the peculiar power of Rome. By that it
was she succeeded where Athens, for example, had conspicuously failed.

The Athenian democracy suffered much from that narrowness
of «patriotism», which is the ruin of all nations, Athens was disliked and
envied by her own empire because she dominated it in a spirit of civic egotism;
her disasters were not felt and shared as disasters by her subject-cities. The
shrewder, nobler Roman senators of the great years of Rome, before the first
Punic War overstrained her moral strength and began her degeneration, were not
only willing in the last resort to share their privileges with the mass of their
own people, but eager to incorporate their sturdiest antagonists upon terms of
equality with themselves. They extended their citizenship cautiously but
steadily. Some cities became Roman, with even a voting share in the government.
Others had self-government and the right to trade or marry in Rome, without
full Roman citizenship. Garrisons of full citizens were set up at strategic
points, and colonies with variable privileges established amidst the purely
conquered peoples. The need to keep communications open in this great and
growing mass of citizenship was evident from the first. Printing and paper were
not yet available for intercourse, but a system of high roads followed the
Latin speech and the Roman rule. The first of these, the Appian Way, ran from
Rome ultimately into the heel of Italy. It was begun by the censor Appius
Claudius (who must not be confused with the decemvir Appius Claudius of a
century earlier) in 312 B.C.

According to a census made in 265 B.C., there were already
in the Roman dominions, that is to say in Italy south of the Arno, 300,000
citizens. They all had a common interest in the welfare of the state; they were
all touched a little with the diffused kingship of the republic. This was, we
have to note, an absolutely new thing in the history of mankind. All
considerable states and kingdoms and empires hitherto had been communities by
mere obedience to some head, some monarch, upon whose moods and character the
public welfare was helplessly dependent, No republic had hitherto succeeded in
being anything more than a city state. The so-called Athenian «empire» was
simply a city-state directing its allies and its, subjugated cities. In a few
decades the Roman republic was destined to extend its, citizenship into the
valley of the Po, to assimilate the kindred Gauls, replacing their language by
Latin, and to set up a Latin city, Aquileia, at the very head of the Adriatic
Sea. In 89 B.C. all free inhabitants of Italy became Roman citizens; in 212
A.D. the citizenship was extended to all free men in the empire.

This extraordinary political growth was manifestly the
precursor of all modern states of the western type. It is as interesting to the
political student, therefore, as a carboniferous, amphibian or an 
*archaeopteryx* to the student of
zoological development. It is the primitive type of the new dominant order. Its
experiences throw light upon all subsequent political history.

One natural result of this growth of a democracy of
hundreds of thousands of citizens scattered over the greater part of Italy was
the growth in power of the Senate. There had been in the development of the
Roman constitution a variety of forms of the popular assembly, the plebeian
assembly, the assembly by tribes, the assembly by centuries, and the like, into
which variety we cannot enter here with any fullness; but the idea was
established that with the popular assembly lay the power of initiating laws. It
is to be noted that there was a sort of parallel government in this system. The
assembly by tribes or by centuries was an assembly of the 
*whole citizen body,* patrician and plebeian together; the assembly
of the plebeians was of course an assembly only of the plebeian class. Each
assembly had its own officials; the former, the consuls, etc.; the latter, the
tribunes. While Rome was a little state, twenty miles square, it was possible
to assemble something like a representative gathering of the people, but it
will be manifest that with the means of communication existing in Italy at that
time, it was now impossible for the great bulk of the citizens even to keep
themselves informed of what was going on at Rome, much less to take any
effective part in political life there. Aristotle in his Politics had already
pointed out the virtual disenfranchisement of voters who lived out of the city
and were preoccupied with agricultural pursuits, and this sort of
disenfranchisement by mechanical difficulties applied to the vast majority of
Roman citizens. With the growth of Rome an unanticipated weakness crept into
political life through these causes, and the popular assembly became more and
more a gathering of political hacks and the city riffraff, and less and less a
representation of the ordinary worthy citizens. The popular, assembly came
nearest to power and dignity in the fourth century B.C. From that period it
steadily declined in influence, and the new Senate, which was no longer a
patrician body, with a homogeneous and on the whole a noble tradition, but a
body of rich men, ex-magistrates, powerful officials, bold adventurers and the
like, pervaded by a strong disposition to return to the idea of hereditary
qualification, became for three centuries the ruling power in the Roman world.

There are two devices since known to the world which might
have enabled the popular government of Rome to go on developing beyond- its
climax in the days of Appius Claudius the Censor, at the close of the fourth
century B.C., but neither of them occurred to the Roman mind. The first of
these devices was a proper use of print. In our account of early Alexandria we
have already remarked upon the strange fact that printed books did not come
into the world in the fourth or third century B.C. This account of Roman
affairs forces us to repeat that remark. To the modern mind it is clear that a
widespread popular government demands, as a necessary condition for health, a
steady supply of correct information upon public affairs to all the citizens
and a maintenance of interest. The popular governments in the modern states
that have sprung up on either side of the Atlantic during the last two
centuries have been possible only through the more or less honest and thorough
ventilation of public affairs through the press. But in Italy the only way in
which the government at Rome could communicate with any body of its citizens
elsewhere was by sending a herald, and with the individual citizen it could
hold no communication by any means at all.

The second device, for which the English are chiefly
responsible in the history of mankind, which the Romans never used, was the
almost equally obvious one of representative government. For the old Popular
Assembly (in its threefold form) it would have been possible to have
substituted a gathering of delegates. Later on in history, the English did, as
the state grew realize this necessity. Certain men, the Knights of the Shire,
were called up to Westminster to speak and vote for local feeling, and were
more or less formally elected for that end. The Roman situation seems to a
modern mind to, have called aloud for such a modification. It was never made.

The method of assembling the comitia tributa (one of the
three main forms of the Popular Assembly) was by the proclamation of a herald,
who was necessarily inaudible to most of Italy, seventeen days before the date
of the gathering. The augurs, the priests of divination whom Rome had inherited
from the Etruscans, examined the entrails of sacrificial beasts on the night
before the actual assembly, and if they thought fit to say that these gory
portents were unfavourable, the comitia tributa dispersed. But if the augurs
reported that the livers were propitious, there was a great blowing of horns
from the Capitol and from the walls of the city, and the assembly went on. It
was held in the open air, either in the little Forum beneath the Capitol or in
a still smaller recess opening out of the Forum, or in the military exercising
ground, the Campus Martins, now the most crowded part of modem Rome, but then
an open space. Business began at dawn with prayer. There were no seats, and this
probably helped to reconcile the citizen to the rule that everything ended at
sunset.

After the opening prayer came a discussion of the measures
to be considered by the assembly, and the proposals before the meeting were
read out. Is it not astonishing that there were no printed copies distributed?
If any copies were handed about, they must have been in manuscript, and each
copy must have been liable to errors and deliberate falsification. No questions
seem to have been allowed, but private individuals might address the gathering
with the permission of the presiding magistrate.

The multitude then proceeded to go into enclosures like
cattle pens according to their tribes, and each tribe voted upon the measure
under consideration. The decision was then taken not by the majority of the
citizens, but by the majority of tribes, and it was announced by the heralds.

The Popular Assembly by centuries, comitia centuriata, was
very similar in its character, except that instead of thirty-five tribes there
were in the third century B.C. 373 centuries, and there was a sacrifice as well
as prayer to begin with. The centuries, originally military (like the
«hundreds» of primitive English local government), had long since lost any
connection with the number one hundred. Some contained only a few people; some
very many. There were eighteen centuries of knights (equites), who were
originally men in a position to maintain a horse and serve in the cavalry,
though later the Roman knighthood, like knighthood in England, became a vulgar
distinction of no military, mental, or moral significance. (These equites
became a very important class as Rome traded and grew rich; for a time they
were the real moving class in the community. There was as little chivalry left
among them at last as there is in the «honours list» knights of England of
today. The senators from about 200 B.C. were excluded from trade. The equites
became, therefore, the great businessmen, *negotiatores*,
and as *publicani* they fanned the
taxes.) There were in addition, eighty (!) centuries of wealthy men (worth over
100,000 asses), twenty-two of men worth over 75,000 asses, and so on. There
were two centuries each of mechanics and musicians, and the proletarii made up
one century. The decision in the comitia centuriata was by the majority, of
centuries.

Is it any wonder that with the growth of the Roman state
and the complication of its business, power shifted back from such a Popular
Assembly to the Senate, which was a comparatively compact body varying between
three hundred as a minimum, and, at the utmost, nine hundred members (to which
it was raised by Cesar), men who had to do with affairs and big business, who
knew each other more or less, and had a tradition of government and policy? The
power of nominating and calling up the senators vested in the Republic first
with the consuls, and when, some time after, «censors» were created, and many
of the powers of the consuls had been transferred to them, they were also given
this power. Appius Claudius, one of the first of the censors to exercise it,
enrolled freedmen in the tribes and called sons of freedmen to the Senate. But
this was a shocking arrangement to the conservative instincts of the time; the
consuls would not recognize his Senate, and the next censors (304 B.C.) set
aside his invitations. His attempt, however, serves to show how far the Senate
had progressed from its original condition as a purely patrician body. Like the
contemporary British House of Lords, it had become a gathering of big business
men, energetic politicians, successful adventurers, great landowners, and the
like; its patrician dignity was a picturesque sham; but, unlike the British
House of Lords, it was unchecked legally by anything but the inefficient
Popular Assembly we have already described, and by the tribunes elected by the
plebeian assembly. Its legal control over the consuls and proconsuls was not
great; it had little executive power; but in its prestige and experience lay
its strength and influence. The interests of its members were naturally
antagonistic to the interests of the general body of citizens, but for some
generations that great mass of ordinary men was impotent to express its dissent
from the proceedings of this oligarchy. Direct popular government of a state
larger than a city state had already failed therefore in Italy, because as yet
there was no public education, no press, and no representative system; it had
failed though these mere mechanical difficulties, before the first Punic War.
«But its appearance is of enormous interest, as the first appearance of a set
of problems with which the whole political intelligence of the world wrestles
at the present time.

The Senate met usually in a Senate House in the Forum, but
on special occasions it would be called to meet in this or that temple; and
when it had to deal with foreign ambassadors or its own generals (who were not
allowed to enter the city while in command of troops), it assembled in the
Campus Martius outside the walls.
