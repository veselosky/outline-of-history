26.6 The Second Punic War
========================================================================
We can only tell very briefly here of the particulars of
the Second and Third Punic Wars. We have told how Hamilcar began to organize
Spain, and how the Romans forbade him to cross the Ebro. He died in 228 B.C.,
and was followed by his son- in-law Hasdrubal, who was assassinated in 221 B.C.
and succeeded by Hannibal, who was now twenty-six. The actual war was
precipitated by the Romans making a breach of their own regulations, and
interfering with affairs south of the Ebro. Whereupon Hannibal marched straight
through the south of Gaul, and
crossed the Alps (218 B.C.) into Italy.

The history of the next fifteen years is the story of the
most brilliant and futile raid in history. For fifteen years Hannibal held out
in Italy, victorious and unconquered. The Roman generals were no match for the
Carthaginian, and whenever they met him they were beaten. But one Roman
general, P. Cornelius Scipio, had the strategic sense to take a course that
robbed all Hannibal's victories of fruit. At the outbreak of the war he had
been sent by sea to Marseilles, to intercept Hannibal; be arrived three days
late, and, instead of pursuing him, he sent on his army into Spain to cut up
Hannibal's supplies and reinforcements. Throughout all the subsequent war there
remained this Roman army of Spain between Hannibal and his base. He was left
«in the air», incapable of conducting sieges or establishing conquests.

Whenever he met the Romans in open fight he beat them. He
gained two great victories in North Italy, and won over the Gauls to his side.
He pressed south into Etruria, and ambushed, surrounded, and completely
destroyed a Roman army at Lake Trasimene. In 216 B.C. he was assailed by a
vastly superior Roman force under Varro at Cannae, and destroyed it utterly.
Fifty thousand men are said to have been killed and ten thousand prisoners
taken. He was, however, unable to push on and capture Rome because he had no
siege equipment. But Cannae produced other fruits. A large part of Southern
Italy came over to Hannibal, including Capua, the city next in size to Rome,
and the Macedonians allied themselves with him. Moreover, Hiero of Syracuse,
the faithful ally of Rome, was now dead, and his successor Hieronymus turned
over to the Carthaginians. The Romans carried on the war, however, with great
toughness and resolution; they refused to treat with Hannibal after Cannae,
they pressed a slow but finally successful blockade and siege of Capua, and a
Roman army set itself to reduce Syracuse. The siege of Syracuse is chiefly
memorable for the brilliant inventions of the philosopher Archimedes, which
long hold the Romans at bay. We have already named this Archimedes as one of
the pupils and correspondents of the school of the Alexandrian Museum. He was
killed in the final storm of the town. Tarentum (209 B.C.), Hannibal's chief
port and means of supply from Carthage, at last followed Syracuse (212 B.C.)
and Capua (211 B.C.) and his communications, became irregular.

Spain also was wrested bit by bit from the Carthaginian
grip. When at last reinforcements for Hannibal under his brother Hasdrubal (not
to be confused with his brother-in-law of the same name who was assassinated)
struggled through into Italy, they were destroyed at the battle of the Metaurus
(207 B.C.), and the first news that came to Hannibal of the disaster was the
hacked-off head of his brother thrown into his camp.

Thereafter Hannibal was blockaded into Calabria, the heel
of Italy. He had no forces for further operations of any magnitude, and he
returned at last to Carthage in time to command the Carthaginians in the last
battle of the war.

This last battle, the battle of Zama (202 B.C.), was fought
close to Carthage.

It was the first defeat Hannibal experienced and so it is
well to give a little attention to the personality of his conqueror, Scipio
Africanus the Elder, who stands out in history as a very fine gentleman indeed,
a great soldier and a generous man. We have already mentioned a certain P.
Cornelius Scipio who struck at Hannibal's base in Spain; this was his son until
after Zama this son bore the same name of P. Cornelius Scipio, and then the
surname of Africanus was given him. (The younger Scipio Africanus, Scipio
Africanus Minor, who was later to end the Third Punic War, was the adopted son
of the son of this first Scipio Africanus the Elder.) Scipio Africanus was
everything that aroused the distrust, hatred, and opposition of old-fashioned
Romans of the school of Cato. He was young, he was happy and able, he spent
money freely, he was well versed in Greek literature, and inclined rather to
Phrygian novelties in religion than to the sterner divinities of Rome. And he
did not believe in the extreme discretion that then ruled Roman strategy.

After the early defeats of the Second Punic War, Roman
military operations were dominated by the personality of a general, Fabius, who
raised the necessity of avoiding battle with Hannibal into a kind of sacred
principle. For ten years «Fabian tactics» prevailed in Italy. The Romans
blockaded, cut up convoys, attacked stragglers, and ran away whenever Hannibal
appeared. No doubt it was wise for a time after their first defeats to do this
sort of thing, but the business of the stronger power, and Rome was the
stronger power throughout the Second Punic War, is not to tolerate an
interminable war, but to repair losses, discover able generals, train better
armies, and destroy the enemy power. Decision is one of the duties of strength.

To such men as young Scipio, the sly, ineffective
artfulness of Fabianism, which was causing both Italy and Carthage to bleed
slowly to death, was detestable. He clamoured for an attack upon Carthage
itself.

    «But Fabius, on this occasion, filled the city with alarms
    as if the commonwealth was going to be brought into the most extreme danger by
    a rash and indiscreet young man; in short, he scrupled not to do or say
    anything he thought likely to dissuade his countrymen from embracing the
    proposal. With the Senate he carried his point. But the people believed that
    his opposition to Scipio proceeded either from envy of his success, or from a
    secret fear that if this young hero should perform some signal exploit, put an
    end to the war, or even remove it out of Italy, his own slow proceedings
    through the course of so many years might be imputed to indolence or timidity.
    . . . He applied to Crassus, the colleague of Scipio, and endeavoured to
    persuade him not to yield that province to Scipio, but, if he thought it proper
    to conduct the war in that manner, to go himself against Carthage. Nay, he even
    hindered the raising of money for that expedition, so that Scipio was obliged
    to find the supplies as he could. . . . He endeavoured to prevent the young men
    who offered to go as volunteers from giving in their names, and loudly
    declared, both in the Senate and Forum, 'That Scipio did not only himself avoid
    Hannibal, but intended to carry away with him the remaining strength of Italy,
    persuading the young men to abandon their parents, their wives, and native
    city, while an unsubdued and potent enemy was still at their doors. With these
    assertions he so terrified the people, that they allowed Scipio to take with
    him only the legions that were in Sicily, and three hundred of those men who
    had served him with so much fidelity in Spain. . . . After Scipio was gone over
    into Africa, an account was soon brought to Rome of his glorious and wonderful
    achievements. This account was followed by rich spoils, which confirmed it. A
    Numidian king was taken prisoner; two camps were burned and destroyed; and in
    them a vast number of men, arms, and horses; and the, Carthaginians sent orders
    to Hannibal to quit his fruitless hopes in Italy, and return home to defend his
    own country. Whilst every tongue was applauding these exploits of Scipio,
    Fabius proposed that his successor should be appointed, without any shadow of
    reason for it, except what this well-known maxim implies: viz., 'That it is
    dangerous to trust affairs of such importance to the fortune of one man,
    because it is not likely that he will be always successful. . . . Nay, even
    when Hannibal embarked his army and quitted Italy, Fabius ceased not to disturb
    the general joy and to damp the spirits of Rome, for he took the liberty to
    affirm, 'That the commonwealth was now come to her last and worst trial; that
    she had the most reason to dread the efforts of Hannibal when he should arrive
    in Africa, and attack her sons under the walls of Carthage; that Scipio would
    have to do with an army yet warm with the blood of so many Roman generals,
    dictators, and consuls! The city was alarmed with these declamations, and
    though the war was removed into Africa, the danger seemed to approach nearer
    Rome than ever».

Before the battle of Zama there were a brief truce and
negotiations, which broke down through the fault of the Carthaginians. As with
the battle of Arbela, so the exact day of the battle of Zama can be fixed by an
eclipse, which in this case occurred during the fighting. The Romans had been
joined by the Numidians, the hinterland people of Carthage, under their king
Massinissa, and this gave them-for the first time in any battle against
Hannibal-a great superiority of cavalry. Hannibal's cavalry wings were driven
off, while at the same time the sounder discipline of Scipio's infantry enabled
them to open lanes for the charge of the Carthaginian war elephants without
being thrown into confusion. Hannibal attempted to extend his infantry line to
envelop the Roman infantry mass, but while at Cannae all the advantage of
training and therefore of manoeuvring power had been on his side, and he had
been able to surround and massacre a crowd of infantry. He now found against
him an infantry line better than his own. His own line broke as it extended,
the Roman legion charged home, and the day was lost. The Roman cavalry came
back from the pursuit of Hannibal's horse to turn what was already a defeat
into a disastrous rout.

Carthage submitted without any further struggle. The terms
were severe, but they left it possible for her to hope for an honourable
future. She had to abandon Spain to Rome, to give up all her war fleet except
ten vessels, to pay 10,000 talents (£2,400,000), and, what was the most
difficult condition of all, to agree not to wage war without the permission of
Rome. Finally a condition was added that Hannibal, as the great enemy of Rome,
should be surrendered. But he saved his countrymen from this humiliation by
flying to Asia.

These were exorbitant conditions, with which Rome should
have been content. But there are nations so cowardly that they dare not merely
conquer their enemies; they must *mak siccar* and destroy them. The generation
of Romans that saw greatness and virtue in a man like Cato the Censor,
necessarily made their country a mean ally and a cowardly victor.
