26.8 How the Punic War Undermined Roman Liberty
========================================================================
We must note here, in a brief section, a change in the
military system of Rome, after the Second Punic War, that was of enormous
importance in her later development. Up to that period the Roman armies had
been levies of free citizens. Fighting power and voting power were closely
connected; the public assembly by centuries followed the paraphernalia of a
military mobilization, and marched headed by the Equestrian centuries, to the
Campus Martius. The system was very like that of the Boers before the last war
in South Africa. The ordinary Roman citizen, like the ordinary Boer, was a
farmer; at the summons of his country he went «on commando». The Boers were,
indeed, in many respects, the last survivors of Aryanism. They fought extraordinarily
well, but at the back of their minds was an anxious desire to go back to their
farms. For prolonged operations, such as the siege of Veii, the Romans
reinforced and relieved their troops in relays; the Boers did much the same at
the siege of Ladysmith.

The necessity for subjugating Spain after the Second Punic
War involved a need for armies of a different type. Spain was too far off for
periodic reliefs, and the war demanded a more thorough training than was
possible with these on and off soldiers. Accordingly men were enlisted for
longer terms and paid. So the paid soldier first appeared in Roman affairs. And
to pay was added booty. Cato distributed silver treasure among his command in
Spain; and it is also on record that he attacked Scipio Africanus for
distributing booty among his troops in Sicily. The introduction of military pay
led on to a professional army, and this, a century later, to the disarmament of
the ordinary Roman citizen, who was now drifting in an impoverished state into
Rome and the larger towns. The great wars had been won, the foundations of the
empire had been well and truly laid by the embattled farmers of Rome before 200
B.C. In the process the embattled farmers of Rome had already largely
disappeared. The change that began after the Second Punic War was completed,
towards the close of the century in the reorganization of the army by Marius,
as we will tell in its place. After his time we shall begin to write of «the
army», and then of «the legions», and we shall find we are dealing with a new
kind of army altogether, no longer held together in the solidarity of a common
citizenship. As that tie fails, the legions discover another in 
*esprit de corps,* in their common
difference from and their common interest against the general community. They
begin to develop a warmer interest in their personal leaders, who secure them
pay and plunder. Before the Punic Wars it was the tendency of ambitious men in
Rome to court the plebeians; after that time they began to court the legions.
