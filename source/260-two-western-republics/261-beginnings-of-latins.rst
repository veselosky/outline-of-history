26.1 The Beginnings of the Latins
========================================================================
It is now necessary to take up the history of the two great
republics of the Western Mediterranean, Rome and Carthage, and to tell how Rome
succeeded in maintaining for some centuries an empire even greater than that
achieved by the conquests of Alexander. But this new empire was, as we shall
try to make clear, a political structure differing very profoundly in its
nature from any of the great Oriental empires that had preceded it. Great
changes in the texture of human society and in the conditions of social
interrelations had been going on for some centuries. The flexibility and
transferability of money was becoming a power and, like all powers in inexpert
hands, a danger in human affairs. It was altering the relations of rich men to
the state and to their poorer fellow citizens. This new empire, the Roman Empire,
unlike all the preceding empires, was not the creation of a great conqueror. No
Sargon, no Thothmes, no Nebuchadnezzar, no Cyrus nor Alexander nor
Chandragupta, was its fountainhead. It was made by a republic. It grew by a
kind of necessity through new concentrating and unifying forces that were
steadily gathering power in human affairs.

But first it is necessary to give some idea of the state of
affairs in Italy in the centuries immediately preceding the appearance of 
*Rome* in the world's story.

Before 1200 B.C., that is to say before the rise of the
Assyrian empire, the siege of Troy, and the final destruction of Cnossos, but
after the time of Amenophis IV, Italy, like Spain, was probably still inhabited
mainly by dark white people of the more fundamental Iberian or Mediterranean
race. This aboriginal population was probably a thin and backward one. But
already in Italy, as in Greece, the Aryans were coming southward. By 1000 B.C.
immigrants from the north had settled over most of the north and centre of
Italy, and, as in Greece, they had intermarried with their darker predecessors
and established a group of Aryan languages, the Italian group, more akin to the
Keltic (Gaelic) than to any other, of which the most interesting from the
historical point of view was that spoken by the Latin tribes in the plains
south and east of the river Tiber. Meanwhile the Greeks had been settling down
in Greece, and now they were taking to the sea and crossing over to South Italy
and Sicily and establishing themselves there. Subsequently they established
colonies along the French Riviera and founded Marseilles upon the site of an
older Phoenician colony. Another interesting people also had come into Italy by
sea These were a brownish sturdy people, to judge from the pictures they have
left of themselves; very probably they were a tribe of those Aegean»dark
whites» who were being driven out of Greece and Asia Minor and the islands in
between by the Greeks.

    Figure 382: Map — Early Latium

We have already told the tale of Cnossos (Chapter XV) and
of the settlement of the kindred Philistines in Palestine (Chapter XIX, sec 1).
These Etruscans, as they were called in Italy were known even in ancient times
to be of Asiatic origin, and it is tempting, but probably unjustifiable, to
connect this tradition with the Aeneid the sham epic of the Latin poet Virgil,
in which the Latin civilization is ascribed to Trojan immigrants from Asia
Minor. (But the Trojans themselves were probably an Aryan people allied to the
Phrygians.) These Etruscan people conquered most of Italy north of the Tiber
from the Aryan tribes who were scattered over that country. Probably the
Etruscans ruled over a subjugated Italian population, so reversing the state of
affairs in Greece, in which the Aryans were uppermost.

Our map (:ref:`Figure 381`), which may be taken to represent roughly the state
of affairs about 750 B.C. also shows the establishments of the Phoenician
traders, of which Carthage was the chief, along the shores of Africa and Spain.

Of all the peoples actually in Italy, the Etruscans were by
far the most civilized. They built sturdy fortresses of the Mycenaean type of
architecture; they had a metal industry; they used imported Greek pottery of a
very fine type. The Latin tribes on the other side of the Tiber were by
comparison barbaric.

The Latins were still a rude farming people. 'The centre of
their worship was a temple to the tribal god Jupiter, upon the Alban Mount.
There they gathered for their chief festivals very much after the fashion of
the early tribal gathering we have already imagined at Avebury. This gathering
place was not a town. It was a high place of assembly. There was no population
permanently there. There were, however, twelve townships in the Latin league.
At one point upon the Tiber there was a ford, and here there was a trade
between Latins and Etruscans. At this ford Rome had its beginnings. Traders
assembled there, and refugees from the twelve towns found an asylum and
occupation at this trading centre. Upon the seven hills near the ford a number
of settlements sprang up, which finally amalgamated into one city.

Most people have heard the story of the two brothers
Romulus and Remus, who founded Rome, and the legend of how they were exposed as
infants and sheltered and suckled by a wolf. Little value is now attached to
this tale by modern historians. The date 753 B.C. is given for the founding of
Rome, but there are Etruscan tombs beneath the Roman Forum of a much earlier
date than that, and the so-called tomb of Romulus bears an indecipherable
Etruscan inscription.

The peninsula of Italy was not then the smiling land of
vineyards and olive orchards it has since become. It was still a rough country
of marsh and forest, in which the farmers grazed their cattle and made their
clearings. Rome, on the boundary between Latin and Etruscan, was not in a very
strong position for defence. At first there were perhaps Latin kings in Rome
then it would seem the city fell into the hands of Etruscan rulers whose
tyrannous conduct led at last to their expulsion, and Rome became a
Latin-speaking republic. The, Etruscan kings were expelled from Rome in the
sixth century B.C., while the successors of Nebuchadnezzar were ruling by the
sufferance of the Medes in Babylon, while Confucius was seeking a king to
reform the disorders of China, and while Gautama was teaching the Aryan Way to
his disciples at Benares.

Of the struggle between the Romans and the Etruscans we
cannot tell in any detail here. The Etruscans were the better armed, the more
civilized, and the more numerous, and it would probably have gone hard with the
Romans if they had had to fight them alone. But two disasters happened to the
Etruscans which so weakened them that the Romans were able at last to master
them altogether. The first of these was a war with the Greeks of Syracuse in
Sicily which destroyed the Etruscan fleet (474 B.C.), and the second was a
great raid of the Gauls from the north into Italy. These latter people swarmed
into North Italy and occupied the valley of the Po towards the end of the fifth
century B.C., as a couple of centuries later their kindred were to swarm down
into Greece and Asia Minor and settle in Galatia. The Etruscans were thus
caught between hammer and anvil, and after a long and intermittent war the
Romans wore able to capture Veii, an Etruscan fortress, a few miles from Rome,
which had hitherto been a great threat and annoyance to them.

It is to this period of struggle, against the Etruscan monarchs, the Tarquins, that Macaulay's :t:`Lays of Ancient Rome` familiar to every schoolboy, refer.

But the invasion of the Gauls was one of those convulsions
of the nations that leave nothing as it has been before. They carried their
raiding right down the Italian peninsula, devastating all Etruria. They took
and sacked Rome (390 B.C.). According to Roman legends-on which doubt is
thrown-the citadel on the Capitol held out, and this also the Gauls would have
taken by surprise at night, if certain geese had not been awakened by their
stealthy movements and set up such a cackling as to arouse the garrison. After
that the Gauls, who were ill equipped for siege operations, and perhaps
suffering from disease in their camp, were bought off, and departed to the
northward again, and, though they made subsequent raids, they never again
reached Rome.

The leader of the Gauls who sacked Rome was named Brennus.
It is related of him that as the gold of the ransom was being weighed, there
was some dispute about the justice of the counterpoise, whereupon he flung his
sword into the scale, saying, «Vae victis!» («Woe to the vanquished!») a phrase
that has haunted the discussions of all subsequent ransoms and indemnities down
to the present time.

For half a century after this experience Rome was engaged
in a series of wars to establish herself at the head of the Latin tribes. For
the burning of the chief city seems to have stimulated rather than crippled her
energies. However much she had suffered, most of her neighbours seem to have
suffered more. By 290 B.C. Rome was the mistress city of all Central Italy from
the Arno to south of Naples. She had conquered the Etruscans altogether, and
her boundaries marched with those of the Gauls to the north and with the
regions Of Italy under, Greek dominion (Magna Graecia) to the south. Along the
Gaulish boundary she had planted garrisons and colonial cities, and no doubt it
was because of that line of defence that the raiding enterprises of the Gauls
were deflected eastward into the Balkans.

After what we have already told of the history of Greece
and the constitutions of her cities, it will not surprise the reader to learn
that the Greeks of Sicily and Italy were divided up into a number of separate
city governments, of which Syracuse and Tarentum (the modern Taranto) were the
chief, and that they had no common rule of direction or policy. But now,
alarmed at the spread of the Roman power, they looked across the Adriatic for
help, and found it in the ambitions of Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus. Between the
Romans and Pyrrhus these Greeks of Magna Graecia were very much in the same
position that Greece proper had been in, between the Macedonians and the Persians
half a century before.

    Beginning of the 3rd century. Compare with the contemporary :ref:`Figure 339`.

The reader will remember that Epirus, the part of Greece
that is closest to the heel of Italy, was the native land of Olympias, the
mother of Alexander. In the, kaleidoscopic changes, of the map that followed
the death of Alexander, Epirus was sometimes swamped by Macedonia, sometimes
independent. This Pyrrhus was a kinsman of Alexander the Great, and a monarch
of ability and enterprise, and he seems to have planned a career of conquest in
Italy and Sicily. He commanded an admirable army, against which the
comparatively inexpert Roman levies could at first do little.

His army included all the established military devices of
the time, an infantry phalanx, Thessalian cavalry, and twenty fighting
elephants from the east. He routed the Romans at Heraclea (280 B.C.), and
pressing after them, defeated them again at Ausculum (279 B.C.) in their own
territory. Then, instead of pursuing the Romans further, he made a truce with
them, turned his attention to the subjugation of Sicily, and so brought the sea
power of Carthage into alliance against him. For Carthage could not afford to
have a strong power established so close to her as Sicily. Rome in those days
seemed to the Carthaginians a far less serious threat than the possibility of
another Alexander the Great ruling Sicily. A Carthaginian fleet appeared off
the mouth of the Tiber, therefore, to encourage or induce the Romans to renew
the struggle, and Rome and Carthage were definitely allied against the invader.

This interposition of Carthage was fatal to Pyrrhus.
Without any decisive battle his power wilted, and, after a disastrous repulse
in an attack upon the Roman camp of Beneventum, he had to retire to Epirus (275
B.C.).

It is recorded that when Pyrrhus left Sicily, he said he
left it to be the battleground of Rome and Carthage. He was killed three years
later in a battle in the streets of Argos. The war against Pyrrhus was won by
the Carthaginian fleet, and Rome reaped a full half of the harvest of victory.
Sicily fell completely to Carthage, and Rome came down to the toe and heel of
Italy, and looked across the Straits of Messina at her new rival. In eleven
years' time (264 B.C.) the prophecy of Pyrrhus was fulfilled, and the first war
with Carthage, the first of the three Punic\ [#fn1]_ Wars, had begun.
