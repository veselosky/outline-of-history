33.5.2 The Mongols Revert to Tribalism
========================================================================
In the Pamirs, in much of Eastern and Western Turkestan, and to the north,
the Mongols dropped back towards the tribal conditions from which they had been
lifted by Jengis. It is possible to trace the dwindling succession of many of
the small Khans who became independent during this period, almost down to the
present time. The Kalmuks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries founded a
considerable empire, but dynastic troubles broke it up before it had extended
its power beyond Central Asia. The Chinese recovered Eastern Turkestan from them
about 1757. Tibet was more and more closely linked with China, and became the
great home of Buddhism and Buddhist monasticism. Over most of the area of
Western Central Asia and Persia and Mesopotamia, the ancient distinction of
nomad and settled population remains to this day. The townsmen despise and cheat
the nomads, the nomads ill-treat and despise the townsfolk.
