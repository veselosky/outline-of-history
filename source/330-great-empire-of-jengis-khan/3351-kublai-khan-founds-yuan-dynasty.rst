33.5.1 Kublai Khan Founds the Yuan Dynasty
========================================================================
In China the Mongols were already saturated with Chinese civilization by the
time of Kublai. After 1280 The Chinese annals treat Kublai as a Chinese monarch,
the founder of the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). This Mongol dynasty was finally
overthrown by a Chinese nationalist movement which set up the Ming dynasty
(1368-1644), a cultivated and artistic line of emperors, ruling until a northern
people, the Manchus, who were the same as the Kin whom Jengis had overthrown,
conquered China and established a dynasty which gave way only to a native
republican form of government in 1912.

It was the Manchus who obliged the Chinese to wear pigtails as a mark of
submission. The pigtailed Chinaman is quite a recent figure in history. With the
coming of the republic the wearing of the pigtail has ceased to be compulsory,
and many Chinamen no longer wear it.
