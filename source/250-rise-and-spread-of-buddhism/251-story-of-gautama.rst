    Figure 358: Map — The Rise of Buddhism

It is interesting to turn from the mental and moral
activities of Athens and Alexandria, and the growth of human ideas in the
Mediterranean world, to the almost entirely separate intellectual life of
India. Here was a civilization which from the first seems to have grown up upon
its own roots and with a character of its own. It was cut off from the
civilizations to the west and to the east by vast mountain barriers, and desert
regions. The Aryan tribes who had come down into the peninsula soon lost touch
with their kindred to the west and north, and developed upon lines of their
own. This was more particularly the case with those who had passed on into the
Ganges country and beyond. They found a civilization already scattered over
India, the Dravidian civilization. This had arisen independently, just as the
Sumerian, Cretan, and Egyptian civilizations seem to have arisen, out of that
widespread development of the Neolithic culture, the heliolithic culture, whose
characteristics we have already described. They revived and changed this
Dravidian civilization much as the Greeks did the Aegean or the Semites the
Sumerian.

These Indian Aryans were living under different conditions
from those that prevailed to the north-west. They were living in a warmer
climate, in which a diet of beef and fermented liquor was destructive; they
were forced, therefore, to a generally vegetarian dietary, and the prolific
soil, almost unasked, gave them all the food they needed. There was no further
reason for them to wander; the crops and seasons were trust worthy. They wanted
little clothing or housing. They wanted so little that trade was undeveloped.
There was still land for every one who desired to cultivate a patch–and a
little patch sufficed. Their political life was simple and comparatively
secure; no great conquering powers had arisen as yet in India, and her natural
barriers sufficed to stop the early imperialisms to the west of her and to the
east. Thousands of comparatively pacific little village republics and
chieftainships were spread over the land. There was no sea life; there were no
pirate raiders, no strange traders. One might write a history of India coming
down to four hundred years ago and hardly mention the sea.

The history of India for many centuries had been happier,
less fierce, and more dreamlike than any other history. The noblemen, the
rajahs, hunted; life was largely made up of love stories. Here and there a
maharajah arose amidst the rajahs and built a city, caught and tamed many
elephants, slew many tigers, and left a tradition of his splendour and his
wonderful processions.

It was somewhen between 500 and 600 B.C., when Croesus was
flourishing in Lydia and Cyrus was preparing to snatch Babylon from Nabonidus,
that the founder of Buddhism was born in India. He was born in a small
republican tribal community in the north of Bengal under the Himalayas, in what
is now overgrown jungle country on the borders of Nepal. The little state was
ruled by a family, the Sakya clan, of which this man, Siddhattha Gautama, was a
member Siddhattha was his personal name, like Caius or John; Gautama, or
Gotama, his family name, like Caesar or Smith; Sakya his clan name, like
Julius. The institution of caste was not yet fully established in India, and
the Brahmins, though they were privileged and influential, had not yet
struggled to the head of the system; but there were already strongly marked
class distinctions and a practically impermeable partition between the noble
Aryans and the darker common people. Gautama belonged to the former race. His
teaching, we may note, was called the Aryan Path, the Aryan Truth.

It is only within the last half-century that the increasing
study of the Pali language, in which most of the original sources were written,
has given the world a real knowledge of the life and actual thought of Gautama.
Previously his story was overlaid by monstrous accumulations of legend, and his
teaching violently misconceived. But now we have a very human and
understandable account of him.

He was a good-looking, capable young man of fortune, and
until he was twenty-nine he lived the ordinary aristocratic life of his time.
It was not a very satisfying life intellectually. There was no literature
except the oral tradition of the Vedas, and that was chiefly monopolized by the
Brahmins; there was even less knowledge. The world was bound by the snowy
Himalayas to the north and spread indefinitely to the south. The city of
Benares, which had a king, was about a hundred miles away. The chief amusements
were hunting and lovemaking. All the good that life seemed to offer, Gautama
enjoyed. He was married at nineteen to a beautiful cousin. For some years they
remained childless. He hunted and played and went about in his sunny world of
gardens and groves and irrigated rice-fields. And it was amidst this life that
a great discontent fell upon him. It was the unhappiness of a line brain that
seeks employment. He lived amidst plenty and beauty, he passed from
gratification to gratification, and his soul was not satisfied. It was as if he
heard the destinies of the race calling to him. He felt that the existence he
was leading was not the reality of life, but a holiday–a holiday that had gone
on too long.

While he was in this mood he saw four things that served to
point his thoughts. He was driving on some excursion of pleasure, when he came
upon a man dreadfully broken down by age. The poor bent, enfeebled creature
struck his imagination. «Such is the way of life», said Channa, his charioteer,
and «to that we must all come». While this was yet in his mind he chanced upon
a man suffering horribly from some loathsome disease. «Such is the way of
life», said Channa. The third vision was of an unburied body, swollen, eyeless,
mauled by passing birds and beasts and altogether terrible. «That is the way
of. life», said Channa.

The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the
unsatisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the mind of Gautama. And
then he and Channa saw one of those wandering ascetics who already existed in
great numbers in India. These men lived under severe rules, spending much time
in meditation and in religious discussion. For many men before Gautama in that
land of uneventful sunshine had found life distressing and mysterious. These
ascetics were all supposed to be seeking some deeper reality in life, and a
passionate desire to do like-wise took possession of Gautama.

He was meditating upon this project says the, story, when
the news was brought to him that his wife had been delivered of his first-born
son. «This is another tie to break», said Gautama.

He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his
fellow clansmen. There was a great feast and a Nautch dance to celebrate the
birth of this new tie, and in the night Gautama awoke in a great agony of
spirit, «like a man who is told that his house is on fire». In the anteroom the
dancing girls were lying in strips of darkness and moonlight. He called Channa,
and told him to prepare his horse. Then he went softly to the threshold of his
wife's chamber, and saw her by the light of a little oil lamp, sleeping
sweetly, surrounded by flowers, with his infant son in her arm. He felt a great
craving to take up the child in one first and last embrace before he departed,
but the fear of waking his wife prevented him, and at last he turned away and
went out into the bright Indian moonshine to Channa waiting with the horses,
and mounted and stole away.

As he rode through the night with Channa, it seemed to him
that Mara, the Tempter of Mankind, filled the sky and disputed, with him.
«Return», said Mara, «and be a king, and I will make you the greatest of kings.
Go on, and you will fail. Never will I cease to dog your footsteps. Lust or
malice or anger will betray you at last in some unwary moment; sooner, or later
you will be mine».

Very far they rode that night, and in the morning he
stopped, outside the lands of his clan, and dismounted beside a sandy river.
There he cut off his flowing locks with his sword, removed all his ornaments,
and sent them and his horse and sword back to his house by Channa. Then going on
he presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with him, and so having
divested himself of all worldly entanglements, he was free to pursue his search
after wisdom. He made his way southward to a resort of hermits and teachers in
a hilly spur running into Bengal northward from the Vindhya Mountains, close to
the town of Rajgir. There a number of wise men lived in a warren of caves,
going into the town for their simple supplies and imparting their knowledge by
word of mouth to such as cared to come to them.

This instruction must have been very much in the style of
the Socratic discussions that were going on in Athens a couple of centuries
later. Gautama became versed in all the metaphysics of his age. But his acute
intelligence was dissatisfied with the solutions offered him.

The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that
power and knowledge may be obtained by extreme asceticism, by fasting,
sleeplessness, and self-torment, and these ideas Gautama now put to the test.
He betook himself with five disciple companions to the jungle in a gorge in the
Vindhya Mountains, and there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible
penances. His fame spread, «like the sound of a great bell hung in the canopy
of the skies».\ [#fn1]_  But it brought him no sense of truth achieved. One day he
was walking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state.
Suddenly he staggered and fell unconscious. When he recovered, the
preposterousness of these semi-magic ways of attempting wisdom was plain to
him.

He amazed and horrified his five companions by demanding
ordinary food and refusing to continue his self-mortifications. He had realized
that whatever truth a man may reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a
healthy body. Such a conception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land
and age. His disciples deserted him, and went off in a melancholy state to
Benares. The boom of the great bell ceased. Gautama the wonderful had fallen.

For a time Gautama wandered alone, the loneliest figure in
history, battling for light.

When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem,
it makes its advances, it secures its positions step by step, with but little
realization of the gains it has made, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt
illumination, it realizes its victory. So it would seem it happened to Gautama.
He had seated himself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat, when
this sense of clear vision came to him. It seemed to him that he saw life
plain. He is said to have sat all day and all night in profound thought, and
then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.
