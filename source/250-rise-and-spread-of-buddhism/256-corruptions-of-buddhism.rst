25.6 The Corruptions of Buddhism
========================================================================
The intolerance of the Jewish mind did keep its essential
faith clear and clean. The theological disregard of the great Eastern teachers,
neither assenting nor denying, did on the other hand permit elaborations of
explanation and accumulations of ritual from the very beginning. Except for
Gautama's insistence upon Right Views, which was easily disregarded, there was
no *self-cleansing* element in either
Buddhism, Taoism, or Confucianism. There was no effective prohibition of
superstitious practices, spirit raising, incantations, prostrations, and
supplementary worships. At an early stage a process of encrustation began, and
continued. The new faiths caught almost every disease of the corrupt religions
they sought to replace; they took over the idols and the temples, the altars
and the censers.

Tibet today is a Buddhistic country, yet Gautama, could he
return to earth, might go from end to end of Tibet seeking his own teaching in
vain. He would find that most ancient type of human ruler, a god-king,
enthroned, the Dalai Lama, the «living Buddha». At Lhassa he would find a huge
temple filled with priests, abbots, and lamas-he whose only buildings, were
huts and who made no priests-and above a high altar he would behold a huge
golden idol, which he would learn was called «Gautama Buddha»! He would hear
services intoned before this divinity, and certain precepts, which would be
dimly familiar to him, murmured as responses. Bells, incense, prostrations,
would play their part in these amazing proceedings. At one point in the service
a bell would be rung and a mirror lifted up, while the whole congregation, in
an access of reverence, bowed lower. . . .

About this Buddhist countryside he would discover a number
of curious little mechanisms, little wind-wheels and waterwheels spinning, on
which brief prayers were inscribed. Every time these things spin, he would
learn, it counts as a prayer. «To whom?» he would ask. Moreover, there would be
a number of flagstaffs in the land carrying beautiful silk flags, silk flags
which bore the perplexing inscription, *«Om
Mani padme hum»,* «the jewel is in the lotus». Whenever the flag flaps, he
would learn, it was a prayer also, very beneficial to the gentleman who paid
for the flag and to the land generally. Gangs of workmen, employed by pious
persons, would be going about the country cutting this precious formula on
cliff and stone. And this, he would realize at last, was what the world had
made of his religion! Beneath this gaudy glitter was buried the Aryan Way to
serenity of soul.

We have already noted the want of any progressive idea in
primitive Buddhism. In that again it contrasted with Judaism. The idea of a
Promise gave to Judaism a quality no previous or contemporary religion
displayed; it made Judaism historical and dramatic. It justified its fierce
intolerance because it pointed to an aim. In spite of the truth and profundity
of the psychological side of Gautama's teaching, Buddhism stagnated and
corrupted for the lack of that directive idea. Judaism, it must be confessed,
in its earlier phases, entered but little into the souls of men; it let them
remain lustful, avaricious, worldly or superstitious; but because of its
persuasion of a promise and of a divine leadership to serve divine ends, it
remained in comparison with Buddhism bright and expectant, like a cared-for
sword.
