25.2 Teaching and Legend in Conflict
========================================================================
Such is the plain story of Gautama as we gather it from a
comparison of early writings. But common men must have their cheap marvels and
wonders.

It is nothing to them that this little planet should at
last produce upon its surface a man thinking of the past and the future and the
essential nature of existence. And so we must have this sort of thing by some
worthy Pali scribe, making the most of it:

«When the conflict began between the Saviour of the World
and the Prince of Evil a thousand appalling meteors fell. . . . Rivers flowed
back towards their sources; peaks and lofty mountains where countless trees had
grown for ages rolled crumbling to the earth . . . the sun enveloped itself in
awful darkness, and a host of headless spirits filled the air».\ [#fn3]_ 

Of which phenomena history has preserved no authentication.
Instead we have only the figure of a lonely man walking towards Benares.

Extraordinary attention has been given to the tree under
which Gautama had this sense of mental clarity. It was a tree of the fig genus,
and from the first it was treated with peculiar veneration. It was called the
Bo Tree. It has long since perished, but close at hand lives another great tree
which may be its descendant, and in Ceylon there grows to this day a tree, the
oldest historical tree in the world, which we know certainly to have been
planted as a cutting from the Bo Tree in the year 245 B.C. From that time to
this it has been carefully tended and watered; its great branches are supported
by pillars, and the earth has been terraced up about it so that it has been
able to put out fresh roots continually. It helps us to realize the shortness
of all human history to see so many generations spanned by the endurance of one
single tree. Gautama's disciples unhappily have cared more for the preservation
of his tree than of his thought, which from the first they misconceived and
distorted.

At Benares Gautama sought out his five pupils, who were
still leading the ascetic life. There is an account of their hesitation to
receive him when they saw him approaching. He was a backslider. But there was
some power of personality in him that prevailed over their coldness, and he
made them listen to his new convictions. For five days the discussion was
carried on. When he had at last convinced them that he was now enlightened,
they hailed him as the Buddha. There was, already in those days a belief in
India that at long intervals Wisdom returned to the earth and was revealed to
mankind through a chosen person known as the Buddha.

According to Indian belief there have been many such
Buddhas; Gautama Buddha is only the latest one of a series. But it is doubtful
if he himself accepted that title or recognized that theory. In his discourses
he never called himself the Buddha.

He and his recovered disciples then formed a sort of
Academy in the Deer Park at Benares. They made themselves huts, and accumulated
other followers to the number of threescore or more. In the rainy season they
remained in discourse at this settlement, and during the dry weather they
dispersed about the country, each giving his version of the new teachings. All
their teaching was done, it would seem, by word of mouth. There was probably no
writing yet in India at all. We must remember that in the time of Buddha it is
doubtful if even the *Iliad* had been
committed to writing. Probably the Mediterranean alphabet, which is the basis
of most Indian scripts, had not yet reached India. The master, therefore,
worked out and composed pithy and brief verses, aphorisms, and lists of
«points», and these were expanded in the discourse of his disciples. It greatly
helped them to have these points and aphorisms numbered. The modern mind is apt
to be impatient of the tendency of Indian thought to a numerical statement of
things, the Eightfold Path, the Four Truths, and so on, but this enumeration
was a mnemonic necessity in an undocumented world.
