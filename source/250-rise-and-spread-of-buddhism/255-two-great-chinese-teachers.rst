25.5 Two Great Chinese Teachers
========================================================================
It is thought that the vast benefactions of Asoka finally
corrupted Buddhism by attracting to its Order great numbers of mercenary and
insincere adherents, but there can be no doubt that its rapid extension
throughout Asia was very largely due to his stimulus.

It made its way into Central Asia through Afghanistan and
Turkestan, and so reached China. Buddhist teaching had spread widely in China
before 200 B.C. Buddhism found there a popular and prevalent religion, Taoism,
a development of very ancient and primitive magic and occult practices. It was
reorganized as a distinctive cult by Chang Daoling in the days of the Han
dynasty. Tao means the Way, which corresponds closely with the idea of the
Aryan Path. The two religions spread side by side and underwent similar changes,
so that nowadays their outward practice is very similar. Buddhism also
encountered Confucianism, which was even less theological and even more a code
of personal conduct. And finally it encountered the teachings of Lao Tse,
«anarchist, evolutionist, pacifist and moral philosopher»,\ [#fn7]_  which were not
so much a religion as a philosophical rule of life. The teachings of this Lao
Tse were later to become incorporated with the Taoist religion by Chen Tuan,
the founder of modern Taoism.

Confucius, the founder of Confucianism, like the great
southern teacher Lao Tse and Gautama, lived also in the sixth century B.C. His
life has some interesting parallelisms with that of some of the more political
of the Greek philosophers of the fifth and fourth. The sixth century B.C. falls
into the period assigned by Chinese historians to the Chow Dynasty, but in
those days the rule of that dynasty had become little more than nominal; the
emperor conducted the traditional sacrifices of the Son of Heaven, and received
a certain formal respect. Even his nominal empire was not a sixth part of the
China of today. In :doc:`Chapter 24 <../240-science-and-religion-at-alexandria/241-science-of-alexandria>` we have already glanced at the state of affairs
in China at this time; practically China was a multitude of warring states open
to the northern barbarians. Confucius was a subject in one of those states, Lu;
he was of aristocratic birth, but poor; and, after occupying various official
positions, he set up a sort of Academy in Lu for the discovery and imparting of
Wisdom. And we also find Confucius travelling from state to state in China,
seeking a prince who would make him his counsellor and become the centre of a
reformed world. Plato, two centuries later, in exactly the same spirit, went as
adviser to the tyrant Dionysius of Syracuse, and we have already noted the
attitudes of Aristotle and Isocrates towards Philip of Macedonia.

The teaching of Confucius centred upon the idea of a noble
life which he embodied in a standard or ideal, the Aristocratic Man. This
phrase is often translated into English as the Superior Person, but as
«superior» and «person», like «respectable» and «genteel», have long become
semi-humorous terms of abuse, this rendering is not fair to Confucianism. He
did present to his time the ideal of a devoted public man. The public side was
very important to him. He was far more of a constructive political thinker than
Gautama or Lao Tse. His mind was full of the condition of China, and he sought
to call the Aristocratic Mau into existence very largely in order to produce
the noble state. One of his sayings may be quoted here: «It is impossible to
withdraw from the world, and associate with birds and beasts that have no
affinity with us. With whom should I associate but with suffering men? The
disorder that prevails is what requires my efforts. If right principles ruled
through the kingdom, there would be no necessity for me to change its state».

The political basis of his teaching seems to be
characteristic of Chinese moral ideas; there is a much directer reference to
the State than is the case with most Indian and European moral and religious
doctrine. For a time he was appointed magistrate in Chung-tu, a city of the
dukedom of Lu, and here he sought to regulate life to an extraordinary extent,
to subdue every relationship and action indeed to the rule of an elaborate
etiquette. «Ceremonial in every detail, such as we are wont to see only in the
courts of rulers and the households of high dignitaries, became obligatory on
the people at large, and all matters of daily life were subject to rigid rule.
Even the food which the different classes of people might eat was regulated;
males and females were kept apart in the streets; even the thickness of coffins
and the shape and situation of graves were made the subject of regulations.\ [#fn8]_ 

This is all, as people say, very Chinese. No other people
have ever approached moral order and social stability through the channel of
manners. Yet in China, at any rate, the methods of Confucius have had an
enormous effect, and no nation in the world today has such a universal
tradition of decorum and self-restraint.

Later on the influence of Confucius over his duke was
undermined, and he withdrew again into private life. His last days were
saddened by the deaths of some of his most promising disciples. «No intelligent
ruler», he said, «arises to take, me as his master, and my time has come to
die». . . .

But he died to live. Says Hirth, «There can be no doubt
that Confucius has had a greater influence on the development of the Chinese
national character than many emperors taken together. He is, therefore, one of
the essential figures to be considered in connection with any history of China.
That he could influence his nation to such a degree was, it appears to me, due
more to the peculiarity of the nation than to that of his own personality. Had
he lived in any other part of the world, his name would perhaps be forgotten.
As we have seen, he had formed his character and his personal views on man's
life from a careful study of documents closely connected with the moral philosophy
cultivated by former generations.

What he preached to his contemporaries was, therefore, not
all new to them; but, having himself, in the study of old records, heard the
dim voice of the sages of the past, he became, as it were, the megaphone phonograph
through which were expressed to the nation those views which he had derived
from the early development of the nation itself. . . . The great influence of
Confucius's personality on national life in China was due not only to his
writings and his teachings as recorded by others, but also to his doings. His
personal character, as described by his disciples and in the accounts of later
writers, some of which may be entirely legendary, has become the pattern for
millions of those who are bent on imitating the outward manners of a great man.
. . . Whatever he did in public was regulated to the minutest detail by
ceremony. This was no invention of his own, since ceremonial life had been
cultivated many centuries before Confucius; but his authority and example did
much to perpetuate what he considered desirable social practices».

The Chinese speak of Buddhism and the doctrines of Lao Tse
and Confucius as the Three Teachings. Together they constitute the basis and
point of departure of all later Chinese thought. Their thorough study is a
necessary preliminary to the establishment of any real intellectual and moral
community between the great people of the East and the Western world.

There are certain things to be remarked in common of all
these three teachers, of whom Gautama was indisputably the greatest and
profoundest, whose doctrines to this day dominate the thought of the great
majority of human beings; there are certain features in which their teaching
contrasts with the thoughts and feelings that were soon to take possession of
the Western world. Primarily they are personal and tolerant doctrines; they are
doctrines of a Way, of a Path, of a Nobility, and not doctrines of a church or
a general rule. And they offer nothing either for or against the existence and
worship of the current gods. The Athenian philosophers, it is to be noted, had
just the same theological detachment! Socrates was quite willing to bow
politely or sacrifice formally to almost any divinity, reserving his private
thoughts. This attitude is flatly antagonistic to the state of mind that was
growing up in the Jewish communities of Judea, Egypt, and Babylonia, in which
the thought of the one God was first and foremost. Neither Gautama nor Lao Tse
nor Confucius had any inkling of this idea of a 
*jealous* God, a God who would have «none other gods», a God of
terrible Truth, who would not tolerate any lurking belief in magic, witchcraft,
or old customs, or any sacrificing to the god-king or any trifling with the
stern unity of things.
