    Figure 1035: Map — Original German Plan, 1914

We will now review very briefly the main phases of the world struggle, which
had thus commenced. Planned by Germany, it began with a swift attack designed to
«knock out» France while Russia was still getting her forces together in the
East. For a time all went well. Military science is never up to date under
modern conditions, because military men are as a class unimaginative, there
always at any date undeveloped inventions capable of disturbing current tactical
and strategic practice which the military intelligence has declined. The German
plan had been made for some years; it was a stale plan; it could probably have
been foiled at the outset by a proper use of entrenchments and barbed wire and
machine guns, but the French were by no means as advanced in their military
science as the Germans, and they trusted to methods of open warfare that were at
least fourteen years behind the times. They had proper equipment neither of
barbed wire nor machine guns, and there was a ridiculous tradition that the
Frenchman did not fight well behind earthworks. The Belgian frontier was
defended by the fortress of Liège, ten or twelve years out of date, with forts
whose armament had been furnished and fitted in many cases by German
contractors; and the French north-eastern frontier was very badly equipped.
Naturally the German armament firm of Krupp had provided nutcrackers for these
nuts, in the form of exceptionally heavy guns firing high explosive shell. These
defences proved therefore to be mere traps for their garrisons. The French
attacked and failed in the southern Ardennes. The German hosts swung round the
French left with an effect of being irresistible; Liege fell on August 9th,
Brussels was reached on August 20th, and the small British army of about 70,000,
which had arrived in Belgium, was struck at Mons (August 22nd) in overwhelming
force, and driven backward in spite of the very deadly rifle tactics it had
learnt during the South African War. The little British force was pushed aside
westward, and the German right swept down so as to leave Paris to the west and
crumple the entire French army back upon it's self.

So confident was the German higher command at this stage of having won the
war, that by the end of August German troops were already being withdrawn for
the Eastern front, where the Russians were playing havoc in East and West
Prussia. And thou came the French counter-attack, strategically a very swift and
brilliant counter-attack. The French struck back on their center, they produced
an unexpected army on their left, and the small British army, shaken but
reinforced, was still fit to play a worthy part in the counter-stroke. The
German right overran itself, lost its cohesion, and was driven back from the
Marne to the Aisne (Battle of the Marne, September 6th to loth). It would have
been driven back farther had it not had the art of entrenchment in reserve. Upon
the Aisne it stood and dug itself in. The heavy guns, the high explosive shell,
the tanks, needed by the allies to smash up these entrenchments, did not yet
exist.

The Battle of the Marne shattered the original German plan. For a time France
was saved. But the German was not defeated; he had still a great offensive
superiority in men and equipment. His fear of the Russian in the east had been
relieved by a tremendous victory at Tannenberg. His next phase was a headlong,
less elaborately planned campaign to outflank the left of the allied armies and
to seize the Channel ports and cut off supplies coming from Britain to France.
Both armies extended to the west in a sort of race to the coast. Then the
Germans, with a great superiority of guns and equipment, struck at the British
round and about Ypres. They came very near to a break through, but the British
held them.

The war on the Western front settled down to trench warfare. Neither side had
the science and equipment needed to solve the problem of breaking through modern
entrenchments and entanglements, and both sides were now compelled to resort to
scientific men, inventors, and such-like unmilitary persons for counsel and help
in their difficulty. At that time the essential problem of trench warfare had
already been solved; there existed in England, for instance, the model of a
tank, which would have given the allies a swift and easy victory before 1916;
but the professional military mind is by necessity an inferior and unimaginative
mind; no man of high intellectual quality would willingly imprison his gifts in
such a calling; nearly all supremely great soldiers have been either
inexperienced fresh-minded young men like Alexander, Napoleon, and Hoche,
politicians turned soldiers like Julius Cæsar, nomads like the Hun and Mongol
captains, or amateurs like Cromwell and Washington; whereas this war after fifty
years of militarism was a hopelessly professional war; from first to last it was
impossible to get it out of the hands of the regular generals, and neither the
German nor allied headquarters was disposed to regard an invention with
toleration that would destroy their traditional methods. The tank was not only
disagreeably strange to these military gentlemen, but it gave an unprofessional
protection to the common soldiers within it. The Germans, however, did make some
innovations. In February (28) they produced a ratber futile novelty, the flame
projector, the user of which was in constant danger of being burnt alive, and in
April, in the midst of a second great offensive upon the British (second Battle
of Ypres, April 17th to May 17th), they employed a cloud of poison gas. This
horrible device was used against Algerian and Canadian troops; it shook them by
the physical torture it inflicted, and by the anguish of those who died, but it
failed to break through them. For some weeks chemists were of more importance
than soldiers on the allied front, and within six weeks the defensive troops
were already in possession of protective methods and devices.

    Figure 1039: The Western Front, 1915-1918

For a year and a half, until July 1916, the Western front remained in a state
of indecisive tension. There were heavy attacks on either side that ended in
bloody repulses. The French made costly but glorious thrusts at Arras and in
Champagne in *1915,* the British at Loos. &gt;From Switzerland to the North
Sea there ran two continuous lines of entrenchment, sometimes at a distance of
it mile or more, sometimes at a distance of a few feet (at Arras *e.g.*),
and in and behind these lines of trenches millions of men toiled, raided their
enemies, and prepared for sanguinary and foredoomed offensives. In any preceding
age these stagnant masses of men would have engendered a pestilence inevitably,
but here again modern science had altered the conditions of warfare. Certain
novel diseases appeared, trench feet for instance, caused by prolonged standing
in cold water, new forms of dysentery, and the like, but none developed to an
extent to disable either combatant force. Behind this front the whole life of
the belligerent nations was being turned more and more to the task of
maintaining supplies of food, munitions, and, above all, men to supply the
places of those who day by day were killed or mangled. The Germans had had the
luck to possess a considerable number of big siege guns intended for the
frontier fortresses; these were now available for trench smashing with high
explosive, a use no one had foreseen for them. The Allies throughout the first
years were markedly inferior in their supply of big guns and ammunition, and
their losses were steadily greater than the German. Mr. Asquith, the British
Prime Minister, though a very fine practitioner in all the arts of Parliament,
was wanting in creative ability; and it is probably due to the push and hustle
of Mr. Lloyd George (who, presently ousted him in December, 1916) and the clamor
of the British press that this inferiority of supplies was eventually
rectified.

There was a tremendous German onslaught upon the French throughout the first
half of 1916 round and about Verdun. The Germans suffered enormous losses and
were held, after pushing in the French lines for some miles. The French losses
were as great or greater. « *Ils ne passeront pas»,* said and sang the
French infantry and kept their word.

The Eastern German front was more extended and less systematically entrenched
than the Western. For a time the Russian armies continued to press westward in
spite of the Tannenberg disaster. They conquered nearly the whole of Galicia
from the Austrians, took Lemberg on September 2nd, *1914,* and the great
fortress of Przemysl on March 22nd, *1915.* But after the Germans had
failed to break the Western front of the Allies, and after an ineffective Allied
offensive made without proper material, they turned to Russia, and a series of
heavy blows, with a novel use of massed artillery, were struck first in the
south and then at the north of the Russian front. On June 22nd, Przemysl was
retaken, and the whole Russian line was driven back until Vilna (September 2nd)
was in German hands.

In May 1915 (23rd), Italy joined the allies, and declared war upon Austria.
(Not until a year later did she declare war on Germany.) She pushed over her
eastern boundary towards Goritzia (which fell in the summer of 1916), but her
intervention was of little use at that time to either Russia or the two Western
powers. She merely established another line of trench warfare among the high
mountains of her picturesque northeastern frontier.

While the main fronts of the chief combatants were in this state of
exhaustive deadlock, both sides were attempting to strike round behind the front
of their adversaries. The Germans made a series of Zeppelin, and later of
aeroplane raids upon Paris and the east of England. Ostensibly these aimed at
depots, ammunition works, and the like targets of military importance but
practically they bombed promiscuously at inhabited places. At first these
raiders dropped not very effective bombs, but later the size and quality of
these missiles increased, considerable numbers of people were killed and
injured, and very much damage was done. The English people were roused to a
pitch of extreme indignation by these outrages. Although the Germans had
possessed Zeppelins for some years, no one in authority in Great Britain had
thought out the proper methods of dealing with them, and it was not until late
in 1916 that an adequate supply of anti-aircraft guns was brought into play and,
that these raiders were systematically attacked by aero planes. Then came a
series of Zeppelin disasters, and after the spring of 1917 they ceased to be
used for any purpose but sea scouting, and, their place as raiders was taken by
large aero planes (the Gothas). The visits of these latter machines to London
and the east of England became systematic after the summer of 1917. All through
the winter of 1917-18, London on every moonlight night became familiar with the
banging of warning maroons, the shrill whistles of the police alarm, the hasty
clearance of the streets, the distant rumbling of scores and hundreds of
anti-aircraft guns growing steadily to a wild, uproar of thuds and crashes, the
swish of flying shrapnel, and at last, if any of the raiders got through the
barrage, with the dull heavy bang of the bursting bombs. Then presently, amidst
the diminuendo of the gunfire would come the inimitable rushing sound of the
fire brigade engines and the hurry of the ambulances. War was brought home to
every Londoner by these experiences.

While the Germans were thus assailing the nerve of their enemy home
population through the air, they were also attacking the overseas trade of the
British by every means in their power. At the outset of the war they had various
trade destroyers scattered over the world, and a squadron of powerful modern
cruisers in the Pacific, namely, the *Scharnhorst,* the *Gneisenau,*
the *Leipzig,* the *Nurnberg,* and the *Dresden.* Some of the
detached cruisers, and particularly the *Emden,* did a considerable amount
of commerce destroying before they were hunted down, and the main squadron
caught an inferior British-force off the coast of Chile and sank the *Good
Hope* and the *Monmouth* on November 1st, 1914. A month later German
ships were pounced upon by a British force and all (except the *Dresden)*
sunk by Admiral Sturdee in the Battle of the Falkland Isles. After this conflict
the allies remained in undisputed possession of the surface of the sea, a
supremacy, which the great naval Battle of Jutland (May 1st, 1916) did nothing
to shake. The Germans concentrated their attention more and more upon submarine
warfare. From the beginning of the war they had had considerable submarine
successes. On one day, September 22nd, 1914, they sank three powerful cruisers,
the *Aboukir,* the *Hogue,* and the *Cressy,* with 1,473 men.
They continued to levy a toll upon British shipping throughout the war; at first
they hailed and examined passenger and mercantile shipping, but this practice
they discontinued for fear of traps, and in the spring of 1915 they began to
sink ships without notice. In May 1915, they sank the great passenger liner, the
*Lusitania,* without any warning, drowning a number of American citizens.
This embittered American feeling against them, but the possibility of injuring
and perhaps reducing Britain by a submarine blockade was so great, that they
persisted in a more and more intensified submarine campaign, regardless of the
danger of dragging the United States into the circle of their enemies.

Meanwhile, Turkish forces, very ill-equipped, were making threatening
gestures at Egypt across the desert of Sinai.

And while the Germans were thus striking at Britain, their least accessible
and most formidable antagonist, through the air and under the sea, the French
and British were also embarking upon a disastrous flank attack in the east upon
the Central Powers through Turkey. The Gallipoli campaign was finely imagined,
but disgracefully executed. Had it succeeded, the Allies would have captured
Constantinople in 1915. But the Turks were given two months' notice of the
project by a premature bombardment of the Dardanelles in February, the scheme
was also probably betrayed through the Greek Court, and when at last British and
French forces were landed upon the Gallipoli peninsula in April, they found the
Turks well entrenched and better equipped for trench warfare than themselves.
The Allies trusted for heavy artillery to the great guns of the ships, which
were comparatively useless for battering down entrenchments, and among every
other sort of thing that they had failed to foresee, they had not foreseen
hostile submarines. Several great battleships were lost; they went down in the
same clear waters over which the ships of Xerxes had once sailed to their fate
at Salamis. The story of the Gallipoli campaign from the side of the Allies is
at once heroic and pitiful, a story of courage and incompetence, and of life,
material, and prestige wasted, culminating in a withdrawal in January, 1916.

Linked up closely with the vacillation of Greece was the entry of Bulgaria
into the war (October 12th, 1915). The king of Bulgaria had hesitated for more
than a year to make any decision between the two sides. Now the manifest failure
of the British at Gallipoli, coupled with a strong Austro-German attack in
Serbia, swung him over to the Central Powers. While the Serbs were hotly engaged
with the Austro-German invaders upon the Danube he attacked Serbia in the rear,
and in a few weeks the country had been completely overrun. The Serbian army
made a terrible retreat through the mountains of Albania to the coast, where
it's remains were rescued by an Allied fleet.

An Allied force landed at Salonika in Greece, and pushed inland towards
Mouastir, but was unable to render any effectual assistance to the Serbians. It
was the Salonika plan which sealed the fate of the Gallipoli expedition.

To the east, in Mesopotamia, the British, using «Indian troops chiefly, made
a still remoter flank attack upon the Central Powers. An army, very ill provided
for the campaign, was landed at Basra in the November of 1914, and pushed up
towards Bagdad in the following year. It gained a victory at Ctesiphon, the
ancient Arsacid and Sassanid capital within twenty-five miles of Bagdad, but the
Turks were heavily reinforced, there was a retreat to Kut, and there the British
army, under General Townshend, was surrounded and starved into surrender on
April 29th, 1916.

All these campaigns in the air, under the seas, in Russia, Turkey, and Asia,
were subsidiary to the main front, the front of decision, between Switzerland
and the sea; and there the main millions lay entrenched, slowly learning the
necessary methods of modern scientific warfare. There was a rapid progress in
the use of the aeroplane. At the outset of the war aeroplanes had been used
chiefly for scouting, and by the Germans for the dropping of marks for the
artillery. Such a thing as aerial fighting was unheard of. In 1916 the
aeroplanes carried machine guns and fought in the air; their bombing work was
increasingly important, they had developed a wonderful art of aerial
photography, and all the aerial side of artillery work, both with aeroplanes and
observation balloons, had been enormously developed. But the military mind was
still resisting the use of the tank, the obvious weapon for decision in trench
warfare.

Many intelligent people outside military circles understood this quite
clearly. The use of the tank against trenches was an altogether obvious
expedient. Leonardo da Vinci invented an early tank, but what military «expert»
has ever had the wits to study Leonardo? Soon after the South African War, in
1903, there were stories in magazines describing imaginary battles in which
tanks figured, and a complete working model of a tank made by Mr. J. A. Corry of
Leeds, was shown to the British military authorities that of course rejected it
in 1911. Tanks had been invented and re-invented before the war began. But had
the matter rested entirely in the hands of the military, there would never have
been any use of tanks. It was Mr. Winston Churchill, who was at the British
Admiralty in 1915-16, who insisted upon the manufacture of the first tanks, and
it was in the teeth of the grimmest opposition that they were sent to France. To
the British navy, and not to the army, military science owes the use of these
devices. The German military authorities were equally set against them. In July,
1916, Sir Douglas Haig, the British commander-in-chief, began a great offensive,
which failed to break through the German, line. In some places he advanced a few
miles; in others he was completely defeated. There was a huge slaughter of the
new British armies. And he did not use tanks.

In September, when the season was growing too late for a sustained offensive,
tanks first appeared in warfare. A few were put into action by the British in a
not very intelligent fashion. Their effect upon the German was profound, they
produced something like a panic, and there can be little doubt that had they
been used in July in sufficient numbers and handled by a general of imagination
and energy, they would have ended the war there and then. At that time the
Allies were in greater strength than the Germans upon the Western front. The
odds were roughly seven to four. Russia, though fast approaching exhaustion, was
still fighting, Italy was pressing the Austrians hard, and Rumania was just
entering the war on the side of the Allies. But the waste of men in this
disastrous July offensive, and the incompetence of the British military command,
brought the Allied cause to the very brink of disaster.

Directly the British failure of July had reassured the Germans, they turned
on the Rumanians, and the winter of 1916 saw the same fate overtake Rumania that
had fallen upon Serbia in 1915. The year that, had begun with the retreat from
Gallipoli and the surrender of Kut, ended with the crushing of Rumania and with
volleys fired at a landing party of French and British marines by a royalist
crowd in the port of Athens. It looked as though King Constantine of Greece
meant to lead his people in the footsteps of King Ferdinand of Bulgaria. But the
coastline of Greece is one much exposed to naval action. Greece was blockaded,
and a French force from Salonika joined hands with an Italian force from Valona
to cut the king of Greece off from his Central European friends.

(In July, 1917, Constantine was forced to, abdicate by the Allies, and his
son Alexander was made king in his place.)

On the whole, things looked much less dangerous for the Hohenzollern
imperialism at the end of 1916 than they had done after the failure of the first
great rush at the Marne. The Allies had wasted two years of opportunity.
Belgium, Serbia, and Rumania, and large areas of France and Russia, were
occupied by Austro-German troops. Counterstroke after counterstroke had failed,
and Russia was now tottering towards a collapse. Had Germany been ruled with any
wisdom, she might have made a reasonable peace at this time. But the touch of
success had intoxicated her imperialists. They wanted not safety, but triumph,
not world welfare, but world empire. «World power or downfall» was their
formula; it gave their antagonists no alternative but a fight to a conclusive
end.
