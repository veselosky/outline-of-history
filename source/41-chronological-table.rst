41.0 Chronological Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To conclude this Outline, we give here a Table of Leading Events from the
year 800 B.C. to 1920 A.D. Following that we give five time diagrams covering
the period from 1000 B.C. onward, which present the trend of events in a graphic
form.

It is well that the reader should keep in mind an idea of the true
proportions of historical to geological time. The scale of the five diagrams at
the end is such that by it the time diagram on page 142 would be about 8 1/2
times as long, that is to say about 4 feet; that on page 47 showing the interval
since the Eoliths, 555 feet, and that on page 11 representing the whole of
geological time would be somewhere between 12 and, at the longest and most
probable estimate, 260 miles! Let the reader therefore take one of these
chronological tables we give, and imagine it extended upon a long strip of paper
to a distance of 55 feet. He would have to get up and walk about that distance
to note the date of the painting of the Altamira caves, and he would have to go
ten times that distance by the side of the same narrow strip to reach the
earlier Neanderthalers. A mile or so from home, but probably much further away,
the strip might be recording the last of the dinosaurs. And this on a scale
which represents the time from Columbus to ourselves by three inches of
space!

Chronology only begins to be precise enough to specify the exact year of any
event after the establishment of the eras of the First Olympiad and the building
of Rome.

About the year 1000 B.C. the Aryan peoples were establishing themselves in
the peninsulas of Spain, Italy, and the Balkans, and they were established in
North India. Cnossos was already destroyed, and the spacious times of Egypt, of
Thotmes III, Amenophis III, and Rameses II were three or four centuries away.
Weak monarchs of the, XXIst Dynasty were ruling in the Nile Valley. Israel was
united under her early kings; Saul or David or possibly even Solomon may have
been reigning. Sargon I (2750 B.C. of the Akkadian Sumerian Empire was a remote
memory in Babylonian history, more remote than is Constantine the Great from the
world of the present day. Hammurabi had been dead, a thousand years. The
Assyrians were already dominating the less military Babylonians. In 1100 B.C.
Tiglath Pileser I had taken Babylon. But there was no permanent conquest;
Assyria and Babylonia were still separate empires. In China the new Chow dynasty
was flourishing. Stonehenge in England was already a thousand years old.

The next two centuries saw a renascence of Egypt under the XXII Dynasty, the
splitting up of the brief little Hebrew kindgom of Solomon, the spreading of the
Greeks in the Balkans, South Italy and Asia Minor, and the days of Etruscan
predominance in Central Italy. We may begin our list of ascertainable dates
