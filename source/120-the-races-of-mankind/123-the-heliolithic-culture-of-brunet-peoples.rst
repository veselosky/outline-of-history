12.3 The Heliolithic Culture of Brunet Peoples
================================================================

The Mediterranean or Iberian division of the Caucasian race had a wider range
in early times, and was a less specialized and distinctive type than the
Nordic. It is very hard to define its southward boundaries from the Negro, or
to mark off its early traces in Central Asia from those of early Mongolians.
Wilfred Scawen Blunt\ [#fn1]_ says that Huxley "had long suspected a common
origin of the Egyptians and the Dravidians of India, perhaps a long belt of
brown-skinned men from India to Spain in very early days".

It is possible that this "belt" of Huxley's of dark-white and brown-skinned
men, this race of brunet-brown folk, ultimately spread even farther than
India; that they reached to the shores of the Pacific, and that they were
everywhere the original possessors of the Neolithic culture and the beginners
of what we call civilization. It is possible that these Brunet peoples are so
to speak the basic peoples of our modern world. The Nordic and the Mongolian
peoples may have been but northwestern and northeastern branches from this
more fundamental stem. Or the Nordic race may have been a branch, while the
Mongolian, like the Negro, may have been another equal and distinct stem with
which the brunet-browns met and mingled in South China. Or the Nordic peoples
also may have developed separately from a Paleolithic stage.

At some period in human history (see Elliot Smith's `The Migrations Of Early Culture`_) there seems to have been a special type of Neolithic culture
widely distributed in the world which had a group of features so curious and
so unlikely to have been independently developed in different regions of the
earth, as to compel us to believe that it was in effect one culture. It
reached through all the regions inhabited by the brunet Mediterranean race,
and beyond through India, further India, up the Pacific coast of China, and
it spread at last across the Pacific and to Mexico and Peru. It was a coastal
culture not reaching deeply inland.

This peculiar development of the Neolithic culture, which Elliot Smith called
the *heliolithic* \ [#fn2]_ culture, included many or all of the following odd
practices:

1.  circumcision,
2.  the very queer custom of sending the *father* to bed when a child is
    born, known as the couvade,
3.  the practice of massage,
4.  the making of mummies,
5.  megalithic monuments\ [#fn3]_ (e.g. Stonehenge),
6.  artificial deformation of the heads of the young by bandages,
7.  tattooing,
8.  religious association of the sun and the serpent, and
9.  the use of the symbol known as the swastika (see :ref:`Figure 115`) for
    good luck. This odd little symbol spins gaily round the world; it seems
    incredible that men would have invented and made a pet of it twice over.

Elliot Smith traces these associated practices in a sort of constellation all
over this great Mediterranean-India Ocean-Pacific area. Where one occurs,
most of the others occur. They link Brittany with Borneo and Peru. But this
constellation of practices does not crop up in the primitive homes of Nordic
or Mongolian peoples, nor does it extend southward much beyond equatorial
Africa.

For thousands of years, from 15,000 to 10,000 B.C., such a heliolithic
culture and its brownish possessors may have been oozing round the world
through the warmer regions of the world, drifting by canoes often across wide
stretches of sea. It was then the highest culture in the world; it sustained
the largest, most highly developed communities. And its region of origin may
have been, as Elliot Smith suggests, the Mediterranean and North African
region. It migrated slowly age by age. It must have been spreading up the
Pacific Coast and across the island stepping-stones to America, long after it
had passed on into other developments in its areas of origin.

Many of the peoples of the East Indies, Melanesia and Polynesia were still in
this heliolithic stage of development when they were discovered by European
navigators in the eighteenth century. The first civilizations in Egypt and
the Euphrates-Tigris valley probably developed directly out of this
widespread culture. We will discuss later whether the Chinese civilization
had a different origin. The Semitic nomads of the Arabian desert seem also to
have had a heliolithic stage.

.. [#fn2] "Sunstone" culture became of the sun worship and the megaliths. This is
    not a very happily chosen term. It suggests a division equivalent to
    paleolithic (old stone) and neolithic (new stone), whereas it is a
    subdivision of the neolithic culture.

.. [#fn3] Megalithic monuments have been made quite recently by primitive Indian peoples.
