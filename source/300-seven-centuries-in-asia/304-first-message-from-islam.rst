30.4 The First Message from Islam
========================================================================
It Was while Heraclius was engaged in restoring order in
this already desolated Syria after the death of Chosroes II, and before the
final peace with Persia, that a strange message was brought to him. The bearer
had ridden over to the imperial outpost at Bostra in the wilderness south of
Damascus. The letter was in Arabic, the obscure Semitic language of the nomadic
peoples of the southern desert; and probably only an interpretation reached
him–presumably with deprecatory notes by the interpreter.

It was an odd, florid challenge from someone who called
himself «Muhammad, the Prophet of God». This Muhammad, it appeared, called upon
Heraclius to acknowledge the one true God and to serve him. Nothing else was
definite in the document.

There is no record of the reception of this missive, and
presumably it went unanswered. The emperor probably shrugged his shoulders, and
was faintly amused at the incident.

But at Ctesiphon they knew more about this Muhammad. He was
said to be a tiresome false prophet, who had incited Yemen, the rich province
of Southern Arabia, to rebel against the King of Kings. Kavadh was much
occupied with affairs he had deposed and murdered his father Chosroes II, and
he was attempting to reorganize the Persian military forces. To him also came a
message identical with that sent to Heraclius. The thing angered them. He tore
up the letter, flung the fragments at the envoy, and bade him be gone.

When this was told to the sender far away in the squalid
little town of Medina, he was very angry. «Even so, 0 Lord!» he cried; «rend
Thou his kingdom from him». (A.D. 628.)
