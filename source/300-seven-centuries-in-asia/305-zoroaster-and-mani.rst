30.5 Zoroaster and Mani
========================================================================
But before we go on to tell of the rise of Islam in the
world, it will be well to complete our survey of the condition of Asia in the
dawn of the seventh century. And a word or so is due to religious developments
in the Persian community during the Sassanid period.

From the days of Cyrus onward Zoroastrianism had prevailed
over the ancient gods of Nineveh and Babylon. Zoroaster (the Greek spelling of
the Iranian «Zarathustra»), like Buddha, was an Aryan. We know nothing of the
age in which he lived; some authorities make him as early as 1000 B.C., others
make him contemporary with Buddha or Confucius; and as little do we know of his
place of birth or his exact nationality. His teachings are preserved to us in
the Zend Avesta, but here, since they no longer play any great part in the
world's affairs, we cannot deal with them in any detail. The opposition of a
good god, Ormuzd, the god of light, truth, frankness, and the sun, and a bad
god, Ahriman, god of secrecy, cunning, diplomacy, darkness, and night, formed a
very central part of his religion. As we find it in history, it is already
surrounded by a ceremonial and sacerdotal system; it has no images, but it has
priests, temples, and altars, on which burn a sacred fire and at which
sacrificial ceremonies are performed. Among other distinctive features is its
prohibition of either the burning or the burial of the dead. The Parsees of
India, the last surviving Zoroastrians, still lay their dead out within certain
open towers, the Towers of Silence, to which the vultures come.

Under the Sassanid kings from Ardashir onward (227), this
religion was the official religion; its head was the second person in the state
next to the king, and the king in quite the ancient fashion was supposed to be
divine or semi-divine and upon terms of peculiar intimacy with Ormuzd.

But the religious fermentation of the world did not leave
the supremacy of Zoroastrianism undisputed in the Persian Empire. Not only was
there a great eastward diffusion of Christianity, to which we have already
given notice, but new sects arose in Persia, incorporating the novel ideas of
the time. One early variant or branch of Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, we have
already named. It had spread into Europe by the first century B.C. after the
eastern campaigns of Pompey the Great. It became enormously popular with the
soldiers and common people, and until the time of Constantine the Great,
continued to be a serious rival to Christianity. Indeed one of his successors,
the Emperor Julian (361-363), known in Christian history as «Julian the
Apostate», made a belated attempt to substitute it for the accepted faith.
Mithras was a god of light, «proceeding» from Ormuzd and miraculously born, in
much the same way that the third person in the Christian Trinity proceeds from
the first. Of this branch of the Zoroastrian stem we need say no more. In the
third century A.D., however, another religion, Manichaeism, arose, which
deserves some notice now.

Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was born the son of a
good family of Ecbatana, the old Median capital (A.D. 216). He was educated at
Ctesiphon. His father was some sort of religious sectary, and be was brought up
in an atmosphere of religious discussion. There came to him that persuasion
that he at last had the complete light, which is the moving power of all
religious initiators. He was impelled to proclaim his doctrine. In A.D. 242, at
the accession of Sapor I, the second Sassanid monarch, he began his teaching.

It is characteristic of the way in which men's minds were
moving in those days that his teaching included a sort of theocrasia. He was
not, he declared, proclaiming anything new. The great religious founders before
him had all been right: Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus Christ–all had been
true prophets, but to him it was appointed to clarify and crown their imperfect
and confused teaching. This he did in Zoroastrian language. He explains the
perplexities and contradictions of life as a conflict of light and darkness,
Ormuzd was God and Ahriman Satan. But how man was created, how he fell from
light into darkness, how he is being disentangled and redeemed from the
darkness, and of the part played by Jesus in this strange mixture of religions
we cannot explain here even if we would. Our interest with the system is
historical and not theological.

But of the utmost historical interest is the fact that Mani
not only went about Iran preaching these new and to him these finally
satisfying ideas of his, but into Turkestan, into India, and over the passes
into China. This freedom of travel is to be noted. It is interesting also because
it brings before us the fact that Turkestan was no longer a country of
dangerous nomads, but a country in which cities were flourishing and men had
the education and leisure for theological argument. The ideas of Mani spread
eastward and westward with great rapidity, and they were a most fruitful
rootstock of heresies throughout the entire Christian world for nearly a
thousand years.

Somewhere about A.D. 270 Mani came back to Ctesiphon and
made many converts. This brought him into conflict with the official religion
and the priesthood. In 277 the reigning monarch had him crucified and his body,
for some unknown reason, flayed, and there began a fierce persecution of his
adherents. Nevertheless, Manichaeism held its own in Persia with Nestorian
Christianity and orthodox Zoroastrianism (Mazdaism) for some centuries.
