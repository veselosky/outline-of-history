30.2 The Sassanid Empire in Persia
========================================================================
We have already drawn a comparison between the brief four
centuries of Roman imperialism and the obstinate vitality of the imperialism of
the Euphrates-Tigris country. We have glanced very transitorily at the
Hellenized Bactrian and Seleucid monarchies that flourished in the eastern half
of Alexander's area of conquest for three centuries, and told how the Parthians
came down into Mesopotamia in the last century B.C. We have described the
battle of Carrhae and the end of Crassus. Thereafter for two centuries and a
half the Parthian dynasty of the Arsacids ruled in the east and the Roman in
the west, with Armenia and Syria between them, and the boundaries shifted east
and west as either side grew stronger. We have marked the utmost eastward
extension of the Roman Empire under Trajan (see map to Chap. XXVIII, sec. 3),
and we have noted that about the same time the Indo-Scythians (Chap. XXVIII,
sec 4) poured down into India.

In 227 occurred a revolution, and the Arsacid dynasty gave
way to a more vigorous line, the Sassanid, a national Persian line under
Ardashir I. In one respect the empire of Ardashir I presented a curious
parallelism with that of Constantine the Great a hundred years later. Ardashir
attempted to consolidate it by insisting upon religious unity, and adopted as
the state religion the old Persian faith of Zoroaster, of which we shall have
more to say later.

This new Sassanid Empire immediately became aggressive, and
under Sapor I, the son and successor of Ardashir, took Antioch. We have already
noted how the Emperor Valerian was defeated (260) and taken prisoner. But as
Sapor was retiring from a victorious march into Asia Minor, he was fallen upon
and defeated by Odenathus, the Arab king of a great desert-trading centre,
Palmyra.

For a brief time under Odenathus, and then under his widow
Zenobia, Palmyra was a considerable state, wedged between the two empires. Then
it fell to the Emperor Aurelian, who carried off Zenobia in chains to grace his
triumph at Rome (272).

We will not attempt to trace the fluctuating fortunes of
the Sassanids during the next three centuries. Throughout that time war between
Persia and the empire of Constantinople wasted Asia Minor like a fever.
Christianity spread widely and was persecuted, for after the Christianization
of Rome the Persian monarch remained the only god-monarch on earth, and he saw
in Christianity merely the propaganda of his Byzantine rival. Constantinople
became the protector of the Christians and Persia of the Zoroastrians; in a
treaty of 422, the one empire agreed to tolerate Zoroastrianism and the other
Christianity. In 483, the Christians of the east split off from the Orthodox
church and became the Nestorian church; which, as we have already noted, spread
its missionaries far and wide throughout Central and Eastern Asia. This
separation from Europe, since it freed the Christian bishops of the east from
the rule of the Byzantine patriarchs, and so lifted from the Nestorian church
the suspicion of political disloyalty, led to a complete toleration of
Christianity in Persia. With Chosroes I (531-579) came a last period of
Sassanid vigour. He was the contemporary and parallel of Justinian. He reformed
taxation, restored the orthodox Zoroastrianism, extended his power into
Southern Arabia (Yemen), which he rescued from the rule of Abyssinian
Christians, pushed his northern frontier into Western Turkestan, and carried on
a series of wars with Justinian. His reputation as an enlightened ruler stood
so high, that when Justinian closed the schools of Athens, the last Greek
philosophers betook themselves to his court. They sought in him the philosopher
king–that mirage which, as we have noted, Confucius and Plato had sought in
their day. The philosophers found the atmosphere of orthodox Zoroastrianism
even less to their taste than orthodox Christianity, and in 549 Chosroes had
the kindness to insert a clause in an armistice with Justinian, permitting
their return to Greece, and ensuring that they should not be molested for their
pagan philosophy or their transitory pro-Persian behaviour.

It is in connection with Chosroes that we hear now of a new
Hunnish people in Central Asia, the Turks, who are we learn, first in alliance
with him and then with Constantinople.

Chosroes II (590-628), the grandson of Chosroes I,
experienced extraordinary fluctuations of fortune. At the outset of his career
he achieved astonishing successes against the empire of Constantinople. Three
times (in 608, 615, and 627) his armies reached Chalcedon, which is over
against Constantinople; he took Antioch, Damascus, and Jerusalem (614), and
from Jerusalem he carried off a cross, said to be the true cross on which Jesus
was crucified, to his capital Ctesiphon. (But some of this or some other true
cross had already got to Rome. It had been brought from Jerusalem, it was said,
by the «Empress Helena», the idealized and canonized mother of Constantine, a
story for which Gibbon displayed small respect.\ [#fn2]_ )

In 619, Chosroes II conquered that facile country, Egypt.
This career of conquest was at least arrested by the Emperor Heraclius (610),
who set about restoring the ruined military power of Constantinople. For some
time Heraclius avoided a great battle while he gathered his forces. He took the
field in good earnest in 623. The Persians experienced a series of defeats
culminating in the battle of Nineveh (627); but neither side had the strength
for the complete defeat of the other.

At the end of the struggle there was still an undefeated
Persian army upon the Bosphorus, although there were victorious Byzantine
forces in Mesopotamia. In 628 Chosroes II was deposed and murdered by his son.
An indecisive peace was concluded between the two exhausted empires a year or
so later, restoring their old boundaries; and the true cross was sent back to
Heraclius, who replaced it in Jerusalem with much pomp and ceremony.
