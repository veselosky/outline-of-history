My contribution to the work includes dividing the text into logical web-sized units (i.e., pages) and embedding into the text cross-links and hyperlinks to external resources. I may also have corrected (or created) typographical errors or misprints, and added the occasional editorial remark. Any such modifications I have made to the text itself and published here, are dedicated to the public domain.

Since the site design is based on copyrighted work, I cannot release this entire site as a public domain work. Once my editing is complete, I do intend to release a file bundle (zip file or tar file) containing the complete public domain work separated from the copyrighted material. Check back for download links later.
