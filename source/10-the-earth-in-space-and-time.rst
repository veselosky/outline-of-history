1.0 The Earth in Space and Time
====================================
The earth on which we live is a spinning globe. Vast though
it seems to us, it is a mere speck of matter in the greater vastness of space.

Space is, for the most part, emptiness. At great intervals
there are in this emptiness flaring centres of heat and light, the «fixed
stars». They are all moving about in space, notwithstanding that they are
called fixed stars, but for a long time men did not realize their motion. They
are so vast and at such tremendous distances that their motion is not
perceived. Only in the course of many thousands of years is it appreciable.
These fixed stars are so far off that, for all their immensity, they seem to
be, even when we look at them through the most powerful telescopes, mere points
of light, brighter or less bright. A few, however, when we turn a telescope
upon them, are seen to be whirls and clouds of shining vapour which we call
nebulae. They are so fax off that a movement of millions of miles would be
imperceptible.

One star, however, is so near to us that it is like a great
ball of flame. This one is the sun. The sun is itself in its nature like a
fixed star, but it differs from the other fixed stars in appearance because it
is beyond comparison nearer than they are; and because it is nearer men have
been able to learn something of its nature. Its mean distance from the earth is
ninety-three million miles. It is a mass of flaming matter, having a diameter
of 866,000 miles. Its bulk is a million and a quarter times the bulk of our
earth.

These are difficult figures for the imagination. If a
bullet fired from a Maxim gun at the sun kept its muzzle velocity unimpaired,
it would take seven years to reach the sun. And yet we say the sun is near,
measured by the scale of the stars. If the earth were a small ball, one inch in
diameter, the sun would be a globe of nine feet diameter; it would fill a small
bedroom. It is spinning round on its axis, but since it is an incandescent
fluid, its polar regions do not travel with the same velocity as its equator,
the surface of which rotates in about twenty-five days. The surface visible to
us consists of clouds of incandescent metallic vapour. At what lies below we
can only guess. So hot is the sun's atmosphere, that iron, nickel, copper, and
tin are present in it in a gaseous state. About it at great distances circle
not only our earth, but certain kindred bodies called the planets. These shine
in the sky because they reflect the light of the sun; they are near enough for
us to note their movements quite easily. Night by night their positions change
with regard to the fixed stars.

It is well to understand how empty is space. If, as we have
said, the sun were a ball nine feet across, our earth would, in proportion, be
the size of a one-inch ball, and. at a distance of 323 yards from the sun. The
moon would be a speck the size of a small pea, thirty inches from the earth.
Nearer to the sun than the earth would be two other very similar specks, the
planets Mercury and Venus, at a distance of 125 and 250 yards respectively.
Beyond the earth would come the planets Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune, at distances of 500, 1,680, 3,000, 6,000, and 9,500 yards
respectively. There would also be a certain number of very much smaller specks,
flying about amongst these planets, more particularly a number called the
asteroids circling between Mars and Jupiter, and occasionally a little puff of
more or less luminous vapour and dust would drift into the system from the
almost limitless emptiness beyond. Such a puff is what we call a comet. 
<i>All the rest of the space about us and
around us and for unfathomable distances beyond is cold, lifeless, and void.</i>
The nearest fixed star to us, <i>on this,
minute scale</i> be it remembered–the earth as a one-inch ball, and the moon a
little pea–would be over 40,000 miles, away. Most of the fixed stars we see
would still be scores and hundreds of millions of miles away.

The science that tells of these things and how men have
come to know about them is Astronomy, and to books of astronomy the reader must
go to learn more about the sun and stars. The science and description of the
world on which we live are called respectively Geology and Geography.

The diameter of our world is a little under 8,000 miles.
Its surface is rough, the more projecting parts of the roughness are mountains,
and in the hollows of its surface there is a film of water, the oceans and
seas. This film of water is about five miles thick at its deepest part–that is
to say, the deepest oceans have a depth of five miles. This is very little in
comparison with the bulk of the world.

About this sphere is a thin covering of air, the
atmosphere. As we ascend in a balloon or go up a mountain from the level of the
sea-shore the air is continually less dense, until at last it becomes so thin
that it cannot support life. At a height of twenty miles there is scarcely any
air at all–not one hundredth part of the density of air at the surface of the
sea. The highest point to which a bird can fly is about four miles up–the condor,
it is said, can struggle up to that; but most small birds and insects which are
carried up by aeroplanes or balloons drop off insensible at a much lower level,
and the greatest height to which any mountaineer has ever climbed is under five
miles. Men have flown in aeroplanes to a height of over four miles, and
balloons with men in them have reached very nearly seven miles, but at the cost
of considerable physical suffering. Small experimental balloons, containing not
men, but recording instruments, have gone as high as twenty-two miles.

It is in the upper few hundred feet of the crust of the
earth, in the sea, and in the lower levels of the air below four miles that
life is found. We do not know of any life at all except in these, films of air
and water upon our planet. So far as we know, all the rest of space is as yet
without life. Scientific men have discussed the possibility of life, or of some
process of a similar kind, occurring upon such kindred bodies as the planets
Venus and Mars. But they point merely to questionable possibilities.

Astronomers and geologists and those who study physics have
been able to tell us something of the origin and history of the earth. They
consider that, vast ages ago, the sun was a spinning, flaring mass of matter,
not yet concentrated into a compact centre of heat and light, considerably
larger than it is now, and spinning very much faster, and that as it whirled, a
series of fragments detached themselves from it, which became the planets. Our
earth is one of these planets. The flaring mass that was the material of the
earth broke into two masses as it spun; a larger, the earth itself, and a
smaller, which is now the dead, still moon. Astronomers give us convincing
reasons for supposing that sun and earth and moon and all that system were then
whirling about at a speed much greater than the speed at which they are moving
to-day, and that at first our earth was a flaming thing upon which no life
could live. The way in which they have reached these conclusions is by a very
beautiful and interesting series of observations and, reasoning, too long and
elaborate for us to deal with here. But they oblige us to believe that the sun,
incandescent though it is, is now much -cooler than it was, and that it spins
more slowly now than it did, and that it continues to cool and slow down. And
they also show that the rate at which the earth spins is diminishing and
continues to diminish–that is to say, that our day is growing longer and
longer, and that the heat at the centre of the earth wastes slowly. There was a
time when the day was not a half and not a third of what it is to-day; when a
blazing hot sun, much greater than it is now, must have moved visibly–had there
been an eye to mark it–from its rise to its setting across the skies. There
will be a time when the day will be as long as a year is now, and the cooling
sun, shorn of its beams, will hang motionless in the heavens.

It must have been in days of a much hotter sun, a far
swifter day and night, high tides, great heat, tremendous storms and.
earthquakes, that life, of which we are a part, began upon the world. The moon
also was nearer and brighter in those days and had a changing face. [#fn01]_
