22.5 Philosophy Becomes Unworldly
========================================================================
The general drift of thought in the concluding years of the
fourth, century B.C. was not with Aristotle, nor towards the laborious and
necessary accumulation of ordered knowledge. It is possible that without his
endowments from the king he would have made but a small figure in intellectual
history. Through them he was able to give his splendid intelligence substance
and effect. The ordinary man prefers easy ways so long as they may be followed,
and is almost wilfully heedless whether they end at last in a cul-de-sac.
Finding the stream of events too powerful to control at once, the generality of
philosophical teachers drifted in those days from the scheming of model cities
and the planning of new ways of living into the elaboration of beautiful and
consoling systems of evasion.

Perhaps that is putting things coarsely and unjustly. But
let Professor Gilbert Murray speak upon this matter.\ [#fn6]_ 

    «The Cynics cared only for virtue and the relation of the
    soul to God; the world and its learning and its honours were as dross to them.
    The Stoics and Epicureans, so far apart at first sight, were very similar in
    their ultimate aim. What they really cared about was ethics-the practical
    question how a man should order his life. Both, indeed, gave themselves to some
    science-the Epicureans, to physics, the Stoics to logic and rhetoric-but only
    as a means to an end. The Stoic tried to win men's hearts and convictions by
    sheer subtlety of abstract argument and dazzling sublimity of thought and
    expression. The Epicurean was determined to make Humanity go its way without
    cringing to capricious gods and without sacrificing Free Will. He condensed his
    gospel into four maxims: «God is not to be feared; Death cannot be felt; the
    Good can be won; all that we dread can be borne and conquered».

And meanwhile the stream of events flowed on, with a reciprocal
indifference to philosophy.
