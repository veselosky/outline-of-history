22.1 The Athens of Pericles
========================================================================
Greek history for the next forty years after Plataea and
Mycale is a story of comparative peace and tranquillity. There were wars, but
they were not intense wars. For a little while in Athens, for a section of the
prosperous, there was leisure and opportunity. And by a combination of
accidents and through the character of a small group of people, this leisure
and opportunity produced the most memorable results. Much beautiful literature
was produced; the plastic arts flourished, and the foundations of modern
science, already laid by the earlier philosophers of the Ionian Greek cities,
were consolidated. Then, after an interlude of fifty odd years, the
long-smouldering hostility between Athens and Sparta broke out into a fierce
and exhausting war, which sapped at last the vitality of this creative
movement.

This war is known in history as the Peloponnesian War; it
went on for nearly thirty years, and wasted all the power of Greece. At first
Athens was in the ascendant, then Sparta. Then arose Thebes, a city not fifty
miles from Athens, to overshadow Sparta. Once more Athens flared into
importance as the head of a confederation. It is a story of narrow rivalries
and inexplicable hatreds that would have vanished long ago out of the memories
of men, were it not that it is recorded and reflected in a great literature.

Through all this time Persia appears and reappears as the
ally first of this league and then of that. About the middle of the fourth
century *B.C.,* Greece becomes aware of
a now influence in its affairs, that of Philip, King of Macedonia. Macedonia
does, indeed, arise in the background of this incurably divided Greece, as the
Medes and Persians arose behind the Chaldean Empire. A time comes when the
Greek mind turns round, so to speak, from its disputes, and stares in one
united dismay at the Macedonian.

Planless and murderous squabbles are still planless and
murderous squabbles even though Thucydides tells the story, even though the
great beginnings of a new civilization are wrecked by their disorders; and in
this general outline we can give no space at all to the particulars of these
internecine feuds, to the fights and flights that sent first this Greek city
and then that up to the sky in flames. Upon a one-foot globe Greece becomes a
speck almost too small to recognize; and in a short history of mankind, all
this century and more of dissension between the days of Salamis and Plataea and
the rise of King Philip shrinks to a little, almost inaudible clash of
disputation, to a more note upon the swift passing of opportunity for nations
as for men.

But what does not shrink into insignificance, because it
has entered into the intellectual process of all subsequent nations, because it
is inseparably a part of our mental foundation, is the literature that Greece
produced during such patches and gleams of tranquillity and security as these
times afforded her.

Says Professor Gilbert Murray:\ [#fn1]_ 

    «Their outer political history, indeed,
    like that of all other nations, is filled with war and diplomacy, with cruelty
    and deceit. It is the inner history, the history of thought and feeling and
    character, that is so grand. They had some difficulties to contend with which
    are now almost out of our path. They had practically no experience, but were
    doing everything for the first time; they were utterly weak in material
    resources, and their emotions, their *'desires
    and fears and rages,'* were probably wilder and fiercer than ours. Yet they
    produced the Athens of Pericles and of Plato».

This remarkable culmination of the long-gathering creative
power of the Greek mind, which for three and twenty centuries has been to men
of intelligence a guiding and inspiring beacon out of the past, flared up after
the battles of Marathon and Salamis had made Athens free and fearless, and,
without any great excesses of power, predominant in her world. It was the work
of a quite small group of men. A number of her citizens lived for the better
part of a generation under conditions which, in all ages, have disposed men to
produce good and beautiful work; they were secure, they were free, and they had
pride; and they were without that temptation of apparent and unchallenged power
which disposes all of us to inflict wrongs upon our fellow men. When political
life narrowed down again to the waste and crimes of a fratricidal war with
Sparta, there was so broad and well-fed a flame of intellectual activity
burning that it lasted through all the windy distresses of this war and beyond
the brief lifetime of Alexander the Great, for a period altogether of more than
a hundred years after the wars began.

Flushed with victory and the sense of freedom, fairly won,
the people of Athens did for a time rise towards nobility. Under the guidance
of a great demagogue, Pericles, the chief official of the Athenian general
assembly, and a politician statesman rather of the calibre of Gladstone or
Lincoln in modem history, they were set to the task of rebuilding their city
and expanding their commerce. For a time they were capable of following a
generous leader generously, and Fate gave them a generous leader. In Pericles
there was mingled in the strangest fashion political ability with a real living
passion for deep and high and beautiful things. He kept in power for over
thirty years. He was a man of extraordinary vigour and liberality of mind. He
stamped these qualities upon his time. As Winckler has remarked, the Athenian
democracy had for a. time «the face of Pericles». He was sustained by what was
probably a very great and noble friendship. There was a woman of unusual
education, Aspasia, from Miletus, whom he could not marry because of the law
that restricted the citizenship of Athens to the home-born, but who was in
effect his wife. She played a large part in gathering about him men of unusual
gifts. All the great writers of the time knew her, and several have praised her
wisdom. Plutarch, it is true, accuses her of instigating a troublesome and
dangerous but finally successful war against Samos, but, as he himself shows
later, this was necessitated by the naval hostility of the Samians, which
threatened the overseas trade of Athens, upon which all the prosperity of the
republic depended.

Men's ambitions are apt to reflect the standards of their
intimates. Pericles was content, at any rate, to serve as a leader in Athens
rather than to dominate as a tyrant. Alliances were formed under his guidance,
new colonies and trading stations were established from Italy to the Black Sea;
and the treasures of the league at Delos were brought to Athens. Convinced of
his security from Persia, Pericles spent the war hoard of the allies upon the
beautification of his city. This was an unrighteous thing to do by our modern
standards, but it was not a base or greedy thing to do. Athens had accomplished
the work of the Delian League, and is not the labourer worthy of his hire? This
sequestration made a time of exceptional opportunity for architects and
artists. The Parthenon of Athens, whose ruins are still a thing of beauty, was
but the crown set upon the clustering glories of the Athens Pericles rebuilt. Such
sculptures as those of Phidias, Myron, and Polyclitus that still survive,
witness to the artistic quality of the time.

The reader must bear in mind that illuminating remark of
Winckler's, which says that this renascent Athens bore for a time the face of
Pericles. It was the peculiar genius of this man and of his atmosphere that let
loose the genius of men about him, and attracted men of great intellectual
vigour to Athens. Athens wore his face for a time as one wears a mask, and then
became restless and desired to put him aside. There was very little that was
great and generous about the common Athenian. We have told of the spirit of one
sample voter for the ostracism of Aristides, and Lloyd (in his Age of Pericles)
declares that the Athenians would not suffer the name of Miltiades to be
mentioned in connection with the battle of Marathon. The sturdy self-respect of
the common voters revolted presently against the beautiful buildings rising
about them; against the favours shown to such sculptors as Phidias over popular
worthies in the same line of business; against the donations made to a mere
foreigner like Herodotus of Halicarnassus; against the insulting preference of
Pericles for the company and conversation of a Milesian woman. The public life
of Pericles was conspicuously orderly, and that presently set the man in the
street thinking that his private life must be very corrupt. One gathers that
Pericles was «superior» in his demeanour; he betrayed at times a contempt for
the citizens he served.

    «Pericles acquired not only an elevation of sentiment, and
    a loftiness and purity of style far removed from the low expression of the
    vulgar, but likewise a gravity of countenance which relaxed not into laughter,
    a firm and even tone of voice, an easy deportment, and a decency of dress which
    no vehemence of speaking ever put into disorder. These things, and others of a
    like nature, excited admiration in all that saw him. Such was his conduct, when
    a vile and abandoned fellow loaded him a whole day with reproaches and abuse;
    he bore it with patience and silence, and continued in public for the despatch
    of some urgent affairs. In the evening he walked softly home, this impudent
    wretch following, and insulting him all the way with the most scurrilous
    language. And as it was dark when he came to his own door, he ordered one of
    his servants to take a torch and light the man home. The poet Ion, however,
    says he was proud and supercilious in conversation, and that there was a great
    deal of vanity and contempt of others mixed with his dignity of manner. . . .
    He appeared not in the streets except when he went to the forum or the senate
    house. He declined the invitations of his friends, and all social
    entertainments and recreations; insomuch that in the whole time of his administration,
    which was a considerable length, he never went to sup with any of his friends
    but once, which was at the marriage of his nephew Euryptolemus, and he stayed
    there only until the ceremony of libation was ended. He considered that the
    freedom of entertainments takes away all distinction of office, and. that
    dignity is but little consistent with
    familiarity. . . ».\ [#fn2]_ 

There was as yet no gutter journalism to tell the world of
the vileness of the conspicuous and successful; but the common man, a little
out of conceit with himself, found much consolation in the art of comedy, which
flourished exceedingly. The writers of comedy satisfied that almost universal
craving for the depreciation of those whose apparent excellence offends our
self-love. They threw dirt steadily and industriously at Pericles and his
friends. Pericles was portrayed in a helmet; a helmet became him, and it is to
be feared he knew as much. This led to much joy and mirth over the pleasant
suggestion of a frightfully distorted bead, an onion head. The «goings on» of
Aspasia were of course a fruitful vineyard for the inventions of the street. .
. .

Dreaming souls, weary of the vulgarities of our time, have
desired to be transferred to the sublime Age of Pericles. But, plumped down
into that Athens, they would have found themselves in very much the atmosphere
of the lower sort of contemporary music-hall, very much in the vein of our
popular newspapers; the same hot blast of braying libel, foul imputation,
greedy «patriotism», and general baseness would have blown upon them, the
«modern note» would have pursued them. As the memories of Plataea and Salamis
faded and the new buildings grew familiar, Pericles and the pride of Athens
became more and more offensive to the homely humour of the crowd. He was never
ostracized-his prestige with the quieter citizens saved him from that; but he
was attacked with increasing boldness and steadfastness. He lived and died a
poor man; he was perhaps the most honest of demagogues; but this did not save
him from an abortive prosecution for peculation. Defeated in that, his enemies
resorted to a more devious method; they began to lop away his friends.

Religious intolerance and moral accusations are the natural
weapons of the envious against the leaders of men. His friend Damon was
ostracized. Phidias was attacked for impiety. On the shield of the great statue
of the goddess Athene, Phidias had dared to put, among the combatants in a
fight between Greeks and Amazons, portraits of Pericles and himself. Phidias
died in prison. Anaxagoras, a stranger welcomed to Athens by Pericles-when
there were plenty of honest fellows already there quite willing to satisfy any
reasonable curiosities-was saying the strangest things about the sun and stars,
and hinting not obscurely that there were no gods, but only one animating
spirit (nous) in the world.\ [#fn3]_ 

The comedy writers suddenly found they had deep religious
feelings that could be profoundly and even dangerously shocked, and Anaxagoras
fled the threat of a prosecution. Then came the turn of Aspasia. Athens seemed
bent upon deporting her, and Pericles was torn between the woman who was the
soul of his life and the ungracious city he had saved defended, and made more
beautiful and unforgettable than any other city in history. He stood up, to
defend Aspasia, he was seized by a storm of very human emotion, and as he spoke
he wept-a gleeful thing for the rabble. His tears saved Aspasia for a time.

The Athenians were content to humiliate Pericles, but he
had served them so long that they were indisposed to do without him. He had
been their leader now for a third of a century.

In 431 B.C. came the war with Sparta. Plutarch accuses
Pericles of bringing it on, because he felt his popularity waned so fast that a
war was needed to make him indispensable.

    «And as he himself was become obnoxious to the people upon
    Phidias's account, and was afraid of being called in question for it, he urged
    on the war, which as yet was uncertain, and blew up that flame which till then
    was stifled and suppressed. By this means he hoped to obviate the accusations
    that threatened him, and to mitigate the rage of envy, because such was his
    dignity and power, that in all important affairs, and in every great danger,
    the republic could place its confidence in him alone».

But the war was a slow and dangerous war, and the Athenian
people were impatient. A certain Cleon arose, ambitious to oust Pericles from
his leadership. There was a great clamour for a swift ending of the war. Cleon
set out to be «the man who won the war». The popular poets got to work in this
fashion:

    | «Thou king of satyrs ... why boast thy prowess,
    | Yet shudder at the sound of sharpened swords,
    | Spite of the flaming Cleon?»

An expedition under the leadership of Pericles was
unsuccessful, and Cleon seized the opportunity for a prosecution.

Pericles was suspended from his command and fined. The
story goes that his oldest son-this was not the son of Aspasia, but of a former
wife-turned against him, and pursued him with vile and incredible accusations.
This young man was carried off by the plague. Then the sister of Pericles died,
and then his last legitimate son. When, after the fashion of the time, he put
the funeral garlands on the boy he wept aloud. Presently he himself took the
contagion and died (428 B.C.).

The salient facts of this brief summary will serve to show
how discordant Pericles was with much of the life of his city. This
intellectual and artistic outbreak in Athens was no doubt favoured by the
conditions of the time, but it was also due in part to the appearance of some
very unusual men. It was not a general movement; it was the movement of a small
group of people exceptionally placed and gifted.
