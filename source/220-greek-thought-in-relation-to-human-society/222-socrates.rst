22.2 Socrates
========================================================================
Another leading figure in this Athenian movement, a figure
still more out of harmony with the life around him, and-quite as much an
original source and stimulant of the enduring greatness of his age, was a man
called Socrates, a son of a stonemason. He was born about sixteen years later
than Herodotus, and he was beginning to be heard of about the time when
Pericles died. He himself wrote nothing, but it was his custom to talk in
public places. There was in those days a great searching for wisdom going on;
there was a various multitude of teachers called sophists who reasoned upon
truth, beauty, and right living, and instructed the developing curiosities and
imaginations of youth. This was so because there were no great priestly schools
in Greece. And, into these discussions this man came, a clumsy and slovenly
figure, barefooted, gathering about him a band of admirers and disciples.

His method was profoundly sceptical; he believed, that the
only possible virtue was true knowledge; he would tolerate no belief, no hope
that could not pass the ultimate acid test. For himself this meant virtue, but
for many of his weaker followers it meant the loss of beliefs and moral habits
that would have restrained their impulses. These weaklings became
self-excusing, self-indulging scoundrels. Among his young associates were
Plato, who afterwards immortalized his method in a series of philosophical
dialogues, and founded the philosophical school of the Academy, which lasted
nine hundred years, Xenophon, of the Ten Thousand, who described his death, and
Isocrates, one of the wisest of Greek political thinkers; but there were also
Critias, who, when Athens was utterly defeated by Sparta, was leader among the
Thirty Tyrants appointed by the Spartans to keep the crushed city
under;\ [#fn4]_ 
Charmides, who was killed beside Critias when the Thirty were overthrown; and
Alcibiades, a brilliant and complex traitor, who did much to lead Athens into
the disastrous expedition against Syracuse which destroyed her strength, who
betrayed her to the Spartans, and who was at last assassinated while on his way
to the Persian court to contrive mischief against Greece. These latter pupils
were not the only young men of promise whose vulgar faith and patriotism
Socrates destroyed, to leave nothing in its place. His most inveterate enemy
was a certain Anytus, whose son, a devoted disciple of Socrates, had become a
hopeless drunkard. Through Anytus it was that Socrates was at last prosecuted
for «corrupting» the youth of Athens, and condemned to death by drinking a
poisonous draught made from hemlock (399 B.C.).

His death is described with great beauty in the dialogue of
Plato called by the name of *Phaedo.*

.. [#fn4]  "But it was not only against the lives, properties, and liberties of
    Athenian citizens that the Thirty made war. They were not less solicitous to
    extinguish the intellectual force and education of the city, a project so
    perfectly in harmony both with the sentiment and practice of Sparta, that they
    counted on the support of their foreign allies. Among the ordinances which they
    promulgated was one, expressly forbidding any one ‘to teach the art of words’.
    The edict of the Thirty was, in fact, a general suppression of the higher class
    of teachers or professors, above the rank of the elementary (teacher of letters
    or) grammatist. If such an edict could have been maintained in force for a
    generation, combined with the other mandates of the Thirty—the city out of which
    Sophocles and Euripides had just died, and in which Plato and Isocrates were in
    vigorous age, would have been degraded to the intellectual level of the meanest
    community in Greece. It was not uncommon for a Grecian despot to suppress all
    those assemblies wherein youths came together for the purpose of common
    training, either intellectual or gymnastic, as well as the public banquets and
    clubs or associations, as being dangerous to his authority, tending to elevation
    of courage, and to a consciousness of political rights among the
    citizens." —Grote’s :t:`History of Greece`.
