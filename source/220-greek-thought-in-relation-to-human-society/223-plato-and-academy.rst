22.3 Plato and the Academy
========================================================================
Plato was born 427 B.C., and he lived for eighty years. In
mental temperament Plato was of an altogether different type from Socrates.

He was a most artistic and delicate writer, and Socrates
could write nothing consecutive. He cared for beautiful things and Socrates
despised them. He was supremely concerned with the ordering of public affairs
and the scheming of happier human relationships, while Socrates, heedless of
heat and cold and the opinion of his fellow creatures, concentrated his mind
upon a serene disillusionment. Life, said Socrates, was deception; only the
Soul lived. Plato had a very great affection for this rugged old teacher, he
found his method of the utmost value in disentangling and cleaning up opinions,
and he made him the central figure of his immortal dialogues; but his own
thoughts and disposition turned him altogether away from the sceptical attitude.
In many of the dialogues the voice is the voice of Socrates, but the thought is
the thought of Plato.

Plato was living in a time of doubt and questioning about
all human relationships. In the great days of Pericles, before 450 B.C., there
seems to have, been a complete satisfaction in Athens with social and political
institutions. Then there seemed no reason for questioning. Men felt free; the
community prospered; one suffered chiefly from jealousy. The history of
Herodotus displays little or no, dissatisfaction with Athenian political
institutions.

But Plato, who was born about the time. Herodotus died, and
who grew up in the atmosphere of a disastrous war and great social distress and
confusion, was from the first face to face with human discord and the misfit of
human institutions. To that challenge his mind responded. One of his earlier
works and his latest are bold and penetrating discussions of the possible
betterment of social relations. Socrates had taught him to take nothing for
granted, not even the common relations of husband and wife or parent and child.
His :t:`Republic,` the first of all
Utopian books, is a young man's dream of a city in which human life is arranged
according to a novel and a better plan; his last unfinished work, the :t:`Laws`, is
a discussion of the regulation of another such Utopia. There is much in Plato
at which we cannot even glance here, but it is a landmark in this history, it
is a new thing in the development of mankind, this appearance of the idea of
willfully and completely recasting human conditions. So far mankind has been
living by tradition under the fear of the gods. Here is a man who says boldly
to our race, and as if it were a quite reasonable and natural thing to say,
«Take hold of your lives. Most of these things that distress you, you can
avoid; most of these things that dominate you, you can overthrow. You can do as
you will with them».

One other thing besides the conflicts of the time perhaps
stimulated the mind of Plato in this direction. In the days of Pericles Athens
had founded many settlements overseas, and the setting up of these settlements
had familiarized men with the idea that a community need not grow, it could
also be made.

Closely associated with Plato was a younger man, who later
also maintained a school in Athens and lived to an even greater age. This was
Isocrates. He was what we should call a publicist, a writer rather than an
orator, and his peculiar work was to develop the idea of Herodotus, the idea of
a unification of Greece against the Persian Empire, as a remedy for the
baseness and confusion of her politics and the waste and destruction of her
internecine wars. His political horizon was in some respects broader than
Plato's, and in his later years he looked towards monarchy, and particularly
towards the Macedonian monarchy of Philip, as a more unifying and broadening
method of government than city democracy. The same drift to monarchist ideas
had occurred in the case of that Xenophon whose
*Anabasis* we have already mentioned. In his old age Xenophon wrote
the Cyropaedia, a «vindication both theoretically and practically of absolute
monarchy as shown in the organization of the Persian
Empire».\ [#fn5]_
