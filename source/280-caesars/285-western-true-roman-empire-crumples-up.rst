28.5 The Western (true Roman) Empire Crumples Up
========================================================================
The first serious irruptions of the German tribes into the
Roman Empire began in the third century with the decay of the central power. We
will not entangle the reader here with the vexed and intricate question of the
names, identity, and inter-relationships of the various Germanic tribes.
Historians find great difficulties in keeping them distinct and these
difficulties are enhanced by the fact that they themselves took little care to
keep themselves distinct. We find in 236 A.D. a people called the Franks
breaking bounds upon the Lower Rhine, and another, the Alamanni, pouring into
Alsace. A much more serious push southward was that of the Goths. We have
already noted the presence of these people in South Russia, and their division
by the Dnieper into Western and Eastern Goths. They had become a maritime
people-again upon the Black Sea-probably their traditional migration from
Sweden was along the waterways, for it is still possible to row a boat, with
only a few quite practicable portages, from the Baltic right across Russia to
either the Black or Caspian Sea and they had wrested the command of the eastern
seas from the control of Rome. They were presently raiding the shores of
Greece. They also crossed the Danube in a great land raid in 247, and defeated
and killed the Emperor Decius in what is now Serbia. The province of Dacia
vanished from Roman history. In 270 they were defeated at Nish in Serbia by
Claudius, and in 276 they were raiding Pontus. It is characteristic of the
invertebrate nature of the empire that the legions of Gaul found that the most
effective method of dealing with the Franks and the Alamanni at this time was
by setting up a separate emperor in Gaul and doing the job by themselves.

Then for a while the barbarians were held, and the Emperor
Probus in 276 forced the Franks and the Alamanni back over the Rhine. But it is
significant of the general atmosphere of insecurity created by these raids that
Aurelian (270-275) fortified Rome, which had been an open and secure city for
all the earlier years of the empire.

In 321 A.D. the Goths were again over the Danube,
plundering what is now Serbia and Bulgaria. They were driven back by
Constantine the Great, of whom we shall have more to tell in the next chapter.
About the end of his reign (337 A.D.) the Vandals, a people closely kindred to
the Goths, being pressed by them, obtained permission to cross the Danube into
Pannonia, which is now that part of Hungary west of the river.

But by the middle of the fourth century the Hunnish people
to the east were becoming aggressive again. They had long subjugated the Alani,
and now they made the Ostrogoths, the east Goths, tributary. The Visigoths (or
west Goths) followed the example of the Vandals, and made arrangements to cross
the Danube into Roman territory. There was some dispute upon the terms of this
settlement, and the Visigoths, growing fierce, assumed the offensive, and at
Adrianople defeated the Emperor Valens, who was killed in this battle. They
were then allowed to settle in what is now Bulgaria, and their army became
nominally a Roman army, though they retained their own chiefs, the foremost of
whom was Alaric. It exhibits the complete «barbarization» of the Roman Empire
that had already occurred, that the chief opponent of Alaric the Goth,
Stilicho, was a Pannonian Vandal. The legions in Gaul were under the command of
a Frank, and the Emperor Theodosius I (emp. 379-395) was a Spaniard chiefly
supported by Gothic auxiliaries.

The empire was now splitting finally into an eastern (Greek
speaking) and a western (Latin-speaking) half. Theodosius the Great was
succeeded by his sons Arcadius at Constantinople and Honorius at Ravenna.
Alaric made a puppet of the eastern monarch and Stilicho of the western. Huns
now first appear within the empire as auxiliary troops enlisted under Stilicho.
In this struggle of East and West, the frontier-if we can still speak of a
frontier between the unauthorized barbarian without and the barbarian in
employment within-gave way. Fresh Vandals, more Goths, Alans, Suevi, marched
freely westward, living upon the country. Amidst this confusion occurred a
crowning event. Alaric the Goth marched down Italy, and after a short siege
captured Rome (410).

By 425 or so, the Vandals (whom originally we noted in East
Germany) and a portion of the Alani (whom we first mentioned in South-east
Russia) had traversed Gaul and the Pyrenees, and had amalgamated and settled in
the south of Spain. There were Huns in possession of Pannonia and Goths in
Dalmatia. Into Bohemia and Moravia came and settled a Slavic people, the Czechs
(451). In Portugal and north of the Vandals in Spain were Visigoths and Suevi.
Gaul was divided among Visigoths, Franks, and Burgundians. Britain was being
invaded by Low German tribes, the Jutes, Angles and Saxons, before whom the
Keltic. British of the south-west were flying across the sea to what is now
Brittany in France. The usual date given for this invasion is 449, but it was
probably earlier.\ [#fn8]_  And as the result of intrigues between two imperial
politicians, the Vandals of the south of Spain, under their king Genseric,
embarked *en masse* for North Africa
(429), became masters of Carthage (439), secured the mastery of the sea,
raided, captured, and pillaged Rome (455), crossed into Sicily, and set up a
kingdom in West Sicily, which endured there for a hundred years (up to 534). At
the time of its greatest extent (477) this Vandal kingdom included also
Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Isles, as well as much of North Africa.

The reader must bear in mind that there was also an annual north-south oscillation (between summer and winter pastures) of all the nomadic peoples. Inset map shows Gothic migrations separately.

About this Vandal kingdom facts and figures are given that
show very clearly the true nature of these barbarian irruptions. They were not
really the conquest and replacement of one people or race by another; what
happened was something very different it was a social revolution started and
masked by a superficial foreign conquest. The whole Vandal nation, men, women,
and children, that came from Spain to Africa, for example, did not number more
than eighty thousand souls. We know this because we have particulars of the
transport problem. In their struggle for North Africa, Dr. Schurtz tells us,
\ [#fn9]_  «there is no trace of any serious resistance offered by the inhabitants;
Boniface (the Roman governor of North Africa) had defended Hippo with Gothic
mercenaries, while the native population lent no appreciable assistance, and
the nomad tribes of the country either Adopted a dubious attitude or availed
themselves of the difficulties of the Roman governor to make attacks and engage
in predatory expeditions. This demoralization resulted from social conditions,
which had perhaps developed more unfavourably in Africa than in other parts of
the Roman Empire. The free peasants bad long ago become the serfs of the great
landed proprietors, and were little superior in position to the masses of
slaves who were everywhere to be found. And the great landowners had become in
their turn easy victims of the policy of extortion followed by unscrupulous
governors to an increasingly unprecedented extent in proportion as the dignity
of the imperial power sank lower. No man who bad anything to lose would now
take a place in the senate of the large towns, which bad once been the goal of
the ambitious, for the senators were required to make up all deficiencies in
the revenue, and such deficiencies were now frequent and considerable . . .
.Bloody insurrections repeatedly broke out, always traceable ultimately to the
pressure of taxation . . . ».

Manifestly the Vandals came in as a positive relief to such
a system. They exterminated the great landowners, wiped out all debts to Roman
Moneylenders, and abolished the last vestiges of military service. The
cultivators found themselves better off; the minor officials kept their places;
it was not so much a conquest as a liberation from an intolerable deadlock.

It was while the Vandals were still in Africa that a great
leader, Attila, arose among the Huns. The seat of his government was in the
plains east of the Danube. For a time he swayed a considerable empire of
Hunnish and Germanic tribes, and his rule stretched from the Rhine into Central
Asia. He negotiated on equal terms with the Chinese emperor. He bullied Ravenna
and Constantinople for ten years. Honoria, the grand-daughter of Theodosius II,
Emperor of the Eastern empire, one of those passionate young ladies who cause
so much trouble in the world, having been put under restraint because of a love
affair with a court chamberlain, sent her ring to Attila and called upon him to
be her husband and deliverer. He was also urged to attack the Eastern Empire by
Genseric the Vandal, who was faced by an alliance of the Western and Eastern
emperors. He raided southward to the very walls of Constantinople, completely
destroying, says Gibbon, seventy cities in his progress, and forcing upon the
emperor an onerous peace, which apparently did not involve the liberation of
Honoria to her hero.

At this distance of time we are unable to guess at the
motives for this omission. Attila continued to speak of her as his affianced
bride, and to use the relationship as a pretext for aggressions. In the
subsequent negotiations a certain Priscus accompanied an embassy to the camp of
the Hunnish monarch, and the fragments that still survive of the narrative he
wrote give us a glimpse of the camp and way of living of the great conqueror.

The embassy was itself a curiously constituted body. Its
head was Maximin, an honest diplomatist who went in good faith. Quite unknown
to him and, at the time, to Priscus, Vigilius, the interpreter of the
expedition, had also a secret mission from the court of Theodosius which was to
secure by bribery the assassination of Attila. The little expedition went by
way of Nish; it crossed the Danube in canoes, dug out of a single tree, and it
was fed by contributions from the villages on the route. Differences in dietary
soon attracted the attention of the envoys. Priscus mentions mead in the place
of wine, millet for corn, and a drink either distilled\ [#fn10]_  or brewed from
barley. The journey through Hungary will remind the reader in many of its
incidents of the journeys of travellers in Central Africa during the Victorian
period. The travellers were politely offered temporary wives.

Attila's capital was rather a vast camp and village than a
town. There was only one building of stone, a bath constructed on the Roman
model. The mass of the people were in huts and tents; Attila and his leading
men lived in timber palaces in great stockaded enclosures with their numerous
wives and ministers about them.

There was a vast display of loot, but Attila himself
affected a nomadic simplicity; he was served in wooden cups and platters, and
never touched bread. He worked hard, kept open court before the gate of his
palace, and was commonly in the saddle. The primitive custom of both Aryans and
Mongols of holding great feasts in hall still held good, and there was much
hard drinking. Priscus describes how bards chanted before Attila. They «recited
the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his valour and his victories.
A profound silence prevailed in the ball, and the attention of the guests was
captivated by the vocal harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of
their own exploits; a martial ardour flashed from the eyes of the warriors, who
were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men expressed their
generous despair, that they could no longer partake the danger and glory of the
field. This entertainment, which might be considered as a school of military
virtue, was succeeded by a farce that debased the dignity of human nature. A
Moorish and Scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of the rude
spectators by their deformed figures, ridiculous dress, antic gestures, absurd
speeches, and the strange, unintelligible confusion of the Latin, the Gothic,
and the Hunnish languages, and the hall resounded with loud and licentious
peals of laughter. In the midst of this intemperate riot, Attila alone, without
change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexible gravity».\ [#fn11]_ 

Although Attila was aware, through the confession of the
proposed assassin, of the secret work of Vigilius, he allowed this embassy to
return in safety, with presents of numerous horses and the like to
Constantinople. Then he despatched an ambassador to Theodosius II to give that
monarch, as people say, a piece of his mind. «Theodosius», said the envoy, «is
the son of an illustrious and respectable parent; Attila, likewise, is
descended from a noble race; and *he*
has supported, by his actions the dignity which he inherited from his father
Munzuk. But Theodosius has forfeited his parental honours, and by consenting to
pay tribute, has degraded himself to the condition of a slave. It is therefore
just that he should reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above
him; instead of attempting, like a wicked slave, clandestinely to conspire
against his master».

This straightforward bullying was met by abject submission.
The emperor sued for pardon, and paid a great ransom.

In 451 Attila declared war on the western empire. He
invaded Gaul. So far as the imperial forces were concerned, he had things all
his own way, and he sacked most of the towns of France as far south as Orleans.
Then the Franks and Visigoths and the imperial forces united against him, and a
great and obstinate battle at Troyes (451), in which over 150,000 men were
killed on both sides, ended in his repulse and saved Europe from a Mongolian
overlord. This disaster by no means exhausted Attila's resources. He turned his
attention southward, and overran North Italy. He burnt Aquileia and Padua, and
looted Milan, but he made peace at the entreaty of Pope Leo I. He died in 453.
. . .

Hereafter the Huns, go far as that name goes in Europe, the
Huns of Attila, disappeared out of history. They dissolve into the surrounding
populations. They were probably already much mixed, and rather Aryan than
Mongolian. They did not become, as one might suppose, the inhabitants of
Hungary, though they have probably left many descendants there. About a hundred
years after came another Hunnish or mixed people, the Avars, out of the east
into Hungary, but these were driven out eastward again by Charlemagne in 791-5.
The Magyars, the modern Hungarians, came westward later. They were a Turko-Finnish
people. The Magyar is a language belonging to the Finno-Ugrian division of the
Ural-Altaic tongues. The Magyars were on the Volga about 550. They settled in
Hungary about 900. . . . But we are getting too far on in our story, and we
must return to Rome.

In 493 Theodoric, a Goth, became King of Rome, but already
for seventeen years there had been no Roman emperor. So it was in utter social
decay and collapse that the great slaveholding «world-ascendancy» of the
God-Caesars and the rich men of Rome came to an end.
