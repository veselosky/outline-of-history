28.3 Limitations of the Roman Mind
========================================================================
We have already shown reason for our statement that the
Roman imperial system was a very unsound political growth indeed. It is absurd
to write of its statecraft; it had none. At its best it had a bureaucratic
administration which kept the peace of the world for a time and failed
altogether to secure it.

Let us note here the main factors in its failure.

The clue to all its failure lies in the absence of any free
mental activity and any organization for the increase, development, and
application of knowledge. It respected wealth and it despised science. It gave
government to the rich, and imagined that wise men could be bought and
bargained for in the slave markets when they were needed. It was, therefore, a
colossally ignorant and unimaginative empire. It foresaw nothing.

It had no strategic foresight, because it was, blankly
ignorant of geography and ethnology.

It knew nothing of the conditions of Russia, Central Asia,
and the East. It was content to keep the Rhine and Danube as its boundaries,
and to make no effort to Romanize Germany. But we need only look at the map of
Europe and Asia showing the Roman Empire to see that a willing and incorporated
Germany was absolutely essential to the life and security of Western Europe.
Excluded, Germany became a wedge that needed only the impact of the Hunnish
hammer to split up the whole system.

Moreover, this neglect to push the boundaries northward to
the Baltic left that sea and the North Sea as a region of experiment and
training and instruction in seamanship for the Northmen of Scandinavia,
Denmark, and the Frisian coast. But Rome went on its way quite stupidly,
oblivious to the growth of a newer and more powerful piracy in the north.

The same unimaginative quality made the Romans leave the
seaways of the Mediterranean undeveloped. When presently the barbarians pressed
down to the warm water, we read of no swift transport of armies from Spain or
Africa or Asia to the rescue of Italy and the Adriatic coasts. Instead, we see
the Vandals becoming masters of the western Mediterranean without so much as a
naval battle.

The Romans had been held at the Euphrates by an array of
mounted archers. It was clear, that as the legion was organized it was useless
in wide open country, and it should have been equally clear that sooner or
later the mounted nomads of east Germany, south Russia or Parthia were bound to
try conclusions with the empire. But the Romans, two hundred years after
Caesar's time, were still marching about, the same drilled and clanking cohorts
they had always been, easily ridden round and shot to pieces. The empire had
learnt nothing even from Carrhae.

The incapacity of the Roman imperialism for novelty in
methods of transport again is amazing. It was patent that their power and unity
depended upon the swift movement of troops and supplies from one part of the
empire to another. The republic made magnificent roads; the empire never
improved upon them. Four hundred years before the Antonines, Hero of Alexandria
had made the first steam engine. Beautiful records of such beginnings of
science were among the neglected treasures of the rich men's libraries
throughout the imperial domains. They were seen lying on stony ground. The
armies and couriers of Marcus Aurelius drudged along the roads exactly as the
armies of Scipio Africanus had done three centuries before them.

The Roman writers were always lamenting the effeminacy of
the age. It was their favourite cant. They recognized that the free men of the
forest and steppes and desert were harder and more desperate fighters than
their citizens, but the natural corollary of developing the industrial power of
their accumulations of population to make a countervailing equipment never
entered their heads. Instead they took the barbarians into their legions,
taught them the arts of war, marched them about the empire, and returned them
with their lesson well learnt to their own people.

In view of these obvious negligences, it is no wonder that
the Romans disregarded that more subtle thing, the soul of the empire,
altogether, and made no effort to teach or train or win its common people into
any conscious participation with its life. Such teaching or training would
indeed have ran counter to all the ideas of the rich men and the imperial
officials. They had made a tool of religion; science, literature, and education
they had entrusted to the care of slaves, who were bred and trained and sold
like dogs or horses; ignorant, pompous, and base, the Roman adventurers of
finance and property who created the empire, lorded it with a sense of the
utmost security while their destruction gathered without the empire and within.

By the second and third centuries A.D. the overtaxed and
overstrained imperial machine was already staggering towards its downfall,
